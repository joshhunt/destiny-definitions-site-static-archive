Jumping to her feet, she scrambled to pick it up, inspecting hurriedly for damage. Her shoulders slumped slightly as her eyes landed on the thin fracture across its face.\n\nEido took a breath, Ether hissing through her rebreather. It didn't calm her.\n\nShe stood within one of the half-ruined rooms of the Eliksni Quarter. Privacy was a luxury in this place, and Eido took it where she could. Now, staring at her datapad, she was even more grateful for the quiet.\n\nEramis had heard Eido recording her Scribe's logs. What else had Eramis intercepted? All of House Light's communications? The petitions to the City for supplies, the transactions for The Ether Tank, her father's instructions to his people?\n\nEido knew that this wasn't possible—or shouldn't be. But her Scribe's logs were unencrypted. She realized now how naïve that had been.\n\nShe took another breath. Eido had reached out to Eramis before, calling for Eliksni unity, and did not think she would receive a reply. But now she knew that Eramis had listened. The Kell had reached out in turn. When Eramis interrupted her Scribe's log, there had been pain in her voice. A pain Eido had never known—a pain she realized her father had tried to keep from her. \n\n\"Eido,\" Misraaks said, appearing at the threshold of the door. His voice was gentle, but Eido flinched nonetheless as her thoughts broke apart. It was worse, somehow, hearing him speak gently. She turned over the cracked datapad, as if to hide what had just transpired.\n\n\"Yes, Misraakskel?\" she answered, too clipped. He bowed his head. Eido stared at her father's silhouette offset by the crumbling building. \n\nSilence hung between them for too long a moment.\n\n\"The Guardian has returned,\" he said, eyes averted. \"We have collected another relic.\"\n\nEven now, there was so much unsaid.\n\n\"A relic of Nezarec,\" she finished flatly for him. He had known since the beginning. He had known and he had lied, while Eramis had not turned away from the truth.\n\nMisraaks said nothing. Eido had been insulted, hurt—and she knew deep down, he would not apologize for any of it. \n\n\"I will study it once I am finished with my Scribe's log,\" Eido said. She turned away from him, and soon, her father's footsteps faded.\n\nShe looked back to the datapad as if Eramis would speak to her again, now that Misraaks had left. But there was nothing. Eido sighed, her thoughts still racing.\n\nEramis had said she could not turn away from her violence or her vengeance. Eido did not believe that—she could not believe it. This violence was not the Kell's spirit. Eido had to find the part of Eramis that did not rage at the past. Eido had to show the Kell of Darkness a future.\n\nSilently, the Scribe of House Light began piecing together the coordinates to the next hideout herself.","icon":"/common/destiny2_content/icons/64a091e20f039c2d95cff84fe862b728.png"}},"2988431740":{"hash":2988431740,"index":2170,"redacted":false,"name":null,"iconImagePath":null,"colorImagePath":null,"displayProperties":{"name":"VIII - HEREALWAYS","description":"The console went dark. The message had ended. Eramis knew there would not be another.\n\n\"Come home, Eramis.\"\n\nEramis closed her eyes. The words settled into the Kell's thoughts. They were heavy. Sharp. She felt herself bleed with them. She had begged for death in the moment that Misraaks's blades were at her throat, and his mercy was a deeper wound than any. It was reopened, now, by the kindness of a child.\n\nEramis remembered her home. \n\nHer home was Riis, devastated by the Great Machine. \n\nHer home was Athrys, her mate, sleeping in a ship long since departed from this system. \n\nHer home was her hatchlings, at her mate's side.\n\nEramis remembered watching them grow and molt. How they had chittered their delight and looked to her with their wide, luminous eyes. \n\nShe would give her House to see those eyes again. But the brightness she had seen in Eido's eyes was a wide, blinding terror. Not only of the Hive. Of her.\n\n\"Come home, Eramis.\"\n\nEramis lived—she lived, and knew what the Eliksni had lost. \n\nThe dream of a new Riis was delicate, and beautiful. Eramis had held it in her hands, close to her chest, for so long. She knew, now, that she had smothered it. In all her violence, in all the death that followed her, she had curled her hands into fists.\n\nThe dream of a new Riis would have died with Eido, if she had been left to the Hive and their putrid Light. But Eido did not know Riis, and neither did her father. They could look beyond that loss.\n\n\"Come home, Eramis.\"\n\nEramis knew she would never see anything but terror in another's eyes. \n\nEramis knew that the Eliksni would find a new home with Eido. \n\nEramis knew there was no place for her in it.","icon":"/common/destiny2_content/icons/64a091e20f039c2d95cff84fe862b728.png"}},"3603776994":{"hash":3603776994,"index":2174,"redacted":false,"name":null,"iconImagePath":null,"colorImagePath":null,"displayProperties":{"name":"IV - Promise","description":"We had discovered a ship full of Human usurpers hiding behind one of the moons of a dusty red world they called Mars. Generations of survivors cowering on a derelict colony ship since the Great Machine failed them. Siviks, Rakis, and I led the raiding party that boarded their vessel. The Humans were malnourished and pitiful, yet they still tried to fight us.\n\nThe battle was short and brutal. I watched Rakis rip a usurper's arms out of the sockets and throw them to the floor. He was so strong back then. We all were. Our growing Ether shares were intoxicating, as was the bloodlust of unrestricted violence. Rakis was massive, even then. Stronger than all of us. One of the Human champions—if they could be called such—challenged Rakis. The rest of us stood by as he tore the Human's limbs off, one by one, and then crushed what was left of the champion's head between his hands. The other Humans threw down their arms and begged for the lives of those who did not fight. Noble, but foolish.\n\nI corralled the survivors into an airlock and sealed them inside. Rakis and Siviks disagreed with me on how we should handle them. Rakis suggested that they would be more valuable in servitude, rather than be given to the cold dark. \"Imagine it,\" he asked of me, \"usurpers wearing the sigil of our House, doing our bidding for us.\"\n\nSiviks seemed amused by this notion. \"Usurpers serving us,\" he said with delight. \"We could steal back the Great Machine's favor by taking from them their identity.\"\n\nRakis reached for the airlock controls, and I struck his hand away. He looked at me with confusion, and attempted again, disrespecting my leadership in front of the others. I knew I had to do something. \n\nWithout hesitation, I evacuated the airlock into space, killing our captives. The brothers, angered, fought back. I held honor to my aspirations. Strength above all. I butchered half the Dregs loyal to Rakis and Siviks, then turned my blades on the brothers. In spite of their struggle, they ended the battle at my feet, half their followers dead and the others huddled in fear. My mother was fluent in the language of violence, but I was eloquent.\n\nI marooned Rakis and Siviks on an asteroid for their final punishment, along with their surviving crew and left them with a knife and my mother's lesson: \"When your crew questions your leadership, you make examples of them.\"\n\nI returned to our Ketch, towing the derelict colony ship. When I told my mother what had become of Rakis and Siviks, I expected her to approve; but instead, I saw something haunted in her eyes. I thought she was ashamed of me, of what I had done, but I was only following her example. I was victorious, and yet in victory, I felt emptier than in any failure.\n\nIt was not until much later that I realized the truth. My mother was not ashamed of me.\n\nShe was ashamed of herself.","icon":"/common/destiny2_content/icons/fbce657b0b863b11100bfb2df9085ba4.png"}},"3915362224":{"hash":3915362224,"index":49,"redacted":false,"name":null,"iconImagePath":null,"colorImagePath":null,"displayProperties":{"name":"The Drowned Captain – 8","description":"\"Spider, I wish to ask you about Phyzann, the Drowned Captain,\" Eido prompted. \"No doubt you've heard the odes.\"\n\nSpider chuckled sardonically. \"I wish I knew who wrote them—I could use a liar like that in my operation.\" \n\n\"My father also doubted their veracity,\" Eido said, intrigued.\n\n\"There was a reason Phyzann died guarding a hole in the ground,\" Spider chortled. \"Craask knew he was a liability.\" \n\n\"If he was so widely ridiculed, why do the odes honor him?\" Eido asked, puzzled.\n\nSpider surveyed The Ether Tank shrewdly. \"It's the first rule of propaganda, little Scribe.
