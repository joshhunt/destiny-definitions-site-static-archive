She heard clarity in the purring mirth emitting from the stone. Three times she had done this, the last leaving several fractures in the bones of her hands. The stone played out her vengeance in a thousand different ways. She studied each path that left Driksys dead and forgotten. She studied those that showed her failure. But there were gaps, and she always needed more. Trihn drew upon the second vial with her golden needle.\n\nIt struck as if bottled lightning. She peeled back the layers. She witnessed it, knew now that the onyx stone had not risen, but was thrust into the floor like a plunging blade. A bannerette in claim. A needlepoint finger. It sold the simple answers in exchange for mental frippery, the unused space between thoughts. A buried name to be revealed.\n\nSuggesting,\n\nthen asking,\n\ninsisting,\n\nimpellent.\n\nEmbedded.\n\nIt tore her consciousness across the cosmos to a grand terrace of onyx Swords, hilted in emerald flame and overlooking darkened systems. A glint in the distance. A world? A name? A promise offered and dragged in Sisyphean humor as voices from the black edges of space converged in laughter. A lone figure stood on the terrace aside two empty thrones. A host of mouths split down the centerline of its form. They screamed with countless voices. Their harmonious epiphany dragged the buried name from the depths, from the pit, from the heap, to the surface.\n\nIt was the only truth before her, and with it, Trihn drowned in regret.\n\nTrihn opened her eyes to Shakto nudging her head. It took every ounce of restraint to keep her blade sheathed. It was the fright, she thought. She hadn't expected him.\n\n\"You were muttering a name.\" He waited for her response.\n\nShe sat up in the dim cavern before the cryptolith and quickly scooted back several paces. Her muscles ached and every small motion splintered pain through torn tendons and micro-fractured bones beneath her skin.\n\n\"What?\" A pulsing irritant was raging inside her head. It wasn't the Ether. This was different.\n\n\"Do you remember the name?\" Shakto moved back to her side and began restoring her injuries.\n\n\"Something is coming here.\" Trihn turned to her Ghost. \"I don't.\"\n\n\"Xivu Arath.\" Shakto saw no recognition in his Lightbearer's eyes, but Trihn felt the name nestle into the small unused crevices of her mind. It had taken hold.\n\nIn the day's journey back to the mainland of the Shore, the name would spread, making war on her thoughts. Trihn would dream of Driksys, always, only to awaken with dug-in fingernails drawing blood from her palms or to find herself alone wailing into the night on some desolate mote of rock. She had been separated from Shakto twice like this before they found a remedy: death. Revival kept the name at bay, but only for so long. She came to know the name through its persistence. Xivu Arath. It would knock her down many times, but she had always found the ritual of righting oneself uplifting. This would not bury her, for she still had much to do.","icon":null}},"370712896":{"hash":370712896,"index":1364,"redacted":false,"name":null,"iconImagePath":null,"colorImagePath":null,"displayProperties":{"name":"Salvation's Grip","description":"[in winding Eliksni script:] This power bestowed by the Dark was given first to the Eliksni—not to the machine-children, who are unlucky second-borns, unstoried and short in their memories.

The third's back was shrouded under a faded tan cloak, tent-poled by the quiver extending from his Orpheus Rig hip plate. Their vehicles: lashed down under camouflaged covers.\n\nShimmering flames licked the interior of the burnt-out transport.

It's chaotic, but through the turmoil, I spot the Scarlett Keep. I see Eris Morn, drawing power from beneath the surface, and I see an army of Dark Guardians stampeding toward us.\n\nI look up to the Leviathan and the Traveler, aglow in a phosphorescent haze. He's doing it. Zavala is overcharging himself with Light, siphoning from the Traveler using Ghaul's plans and tech. Good luck, Commander, and thank you.\n\nAna and Mara fight through the Hive mercilessly as the Dark Guardians approach. I find Ana and signal toward Eris. In lockstep, we carry out our assault. Ana opens fire on a Hunter while I cover her, blasting a flanking Ogre with Stasis. Ana drops a grenade under its massive feet, and a second later, it's dust. Eris spots us, and I swear she's smiling. From behind the Keep, a full brigade of the Awoken armada rises, perverted with Hive thorns and insignia. \n\nNow's the time, Warmind. \n\nAs the Awoken defectors fire onto the battlefield, they're blasted out of the sky by satellite arrays in a dazzling display. I can feel Eris's frustration at this. Then I see her, shrouded in Darkness, performing a summoning ritual. \n\nA singular beam of blinding Light tears through the black sky with the velocity of a shooting star, headed straight for the Scarlett Keep. \n\nGive 'em hell, Commander. \n\nHe collides with the structure so precisely that he only creates a small fissure. After a moment, an explosion, bright and disastrous, completely levels the Keep to rubble. We hear a deafening scream throughout the field that could only be Savathûn. Mara races to us. \"The Witch is weakened. We strike now!\" \n\nEris is regaining her footing as we close in. \"All of my detractors in one place. Thank you for bringing them to me, Ana,\" she says and smiles. \n\nI turn to Ana, confused. She pulls out a knife and readies it toward Mara. I make a move to stop her, but I can't.

She's genuinely hurt, gritting her teeth to stop herself from crying. I try to raise my hand to blast her, but she's already on the move.\n\nAna attacks and stabs me in my side, disconnecting core components. My left arm goes limp. I look up to see Eris summoning a portal. The Vex come flooding through. Our army of Cabal and Fallen are being eviscerated. Vex Hydras swarm the Leviathan and open fire. If I could cry, I would. We lost. Again.\n\nSuddenly, Eris stands above me with a twisted grin. \"Do you see what the path of the self-righteous yields? You call it protection, but all Ana felt was abandonment. You left a void. Darkness filled it.\"\n\n\"You have bigger problems,\" I say, looking to the sky.\n\nA piercing noise emanates from the Traveler. Its brilliance begins to swell. Worried and confused, Eris commands all her forces to focus on killing it with Dark energy.\n\n\"It didn't have to be this way,\" Ana cries as she drives the knife into me once more. \"You could have been with me!\"\n\nI finally shatter my own binding, blasting her with Stasis. She flies back, locked in the air. I see her struggling. \"Ana, she's corrupted you!\" \n\n\"No… She gave me purpose!\" \n\nDamn it all. I know what I have to do. \n\nI kiss her forehead as I turn her blade and thrust it into her. Her eyes go wide, and some semblance of my sister returns before she fades. \n\n\"Elsie…\" she trails off into the void. My own sister… Eris will pay for this. \n\nThe Darkness energy Eris manipulates canvases the landscape and makes its way to the sky.

I fight through the crowd to find Cayde-6 at the center of it. \"I think I finally got him this time!\" he shouts as a beardless Zavala greets him. \n\n\"Taniks has been dead before,\" Zavala says. \n\nFrom behind him emerges Ikora Rey, like a vision. \"Let the new Hunter Vanguard bask.

I catch Ana staring at the spot where we found the Drifter's body.\n\n\"You ever think about what we could have done differently?\" she poses.\n\nAll the time. \n\n\"Not really,\" I answer.\n\n\"So much of this death and destruction stems back to us, to our family.

Is that what it's like to be with friends again, I wonder, as I stare off at the empty sky where the Tower once stood.\n\n\"You were close with the Vanguard, right?\" I ask.\n\n\"I don't know if I'd say 'close.' We had a working relationship. They trusted me.\"\n\n\"Still, must have been nice. Closest thing to a family.\" \n\n\"If Zavala could hear that…\" she trails off. A pensive expression rounds out the lines on her face. \"What was ours like? Our family… before all this.\"\n\n\"Didn't your research tell you, Ana?\"\n\n\"You were with them… with us. You know what they were really like.\"\n\n\"I don't know. We were a family.\" \n\n\"Can you just try a little, for me? You know I don't remember anything. You got to spend time with them. You must be able to tell me something. Anything. What did Mom's hair smell like? What was Dad's favorite song?\"\n\n\"I don't… remember everything. Clovis made sure of that.\"\n\n\"Then tell me what you do know,\" she pleads.\n\n\"I don't want to have this discussion.\"\n\n\"You don't have the right to keep this from me. It's my life, too!\"\n\n\"Drop it, Ana!\" \n\nFrom behind us, we hear the readying of a rifle.\n\nAna looks to me and inches her fingers toward her weapon. \"We don't want trouble.\" \n\nMy hand goes frosty with Stasis while Rasputin's fist clenches.\n\n\"You came to the wrong place,\" the rifleman says.\n\nAna cocks her head and faces him. \"Zavala?\" \n\nI turn to get a look. Before us stands the once proud Commander of the Vanguard, disheveled, in rags. His ghastly white beard is as thick as a steel door. And from the looks of him, a gentle breeze would knock him off his crutch and one remaining leg. They must have taken his Ghost too. Sad to see the deterioration of a body that's been stripped of its Light.\n\n\"Commander! You're alive!\" Ana exclaims.\n\nHe doesn't lower his rifle.\n\n\"It's me… Ana…,\" she says with hurt in her voice.\n\nHis expression never changes.\n\n\"We have a plan to take down Savathûn. We need to speak with Ikora Rey. Is she here?\" I ask.\n\nHe grimaces. \"She is,\" he says and points with his rifle toward the flotsam of the Tower. \"Buried deep under that.\"","icon":"/common/destiny2_content/icons/ac05c474541917635ca7bc1ebc995ff8.png"}},"582234699":{"hash":582234699,"index":1425,"redacted":false,"name":null,"iconImagePath":null,"colorImagePath":null,"displayProperties":{"name":"Chapter 1: The Family Line","description":"Another sleepless night. Not that I require sleep, but it helps me to feel normal… whatever that is. I hear shuffling outside. Probably a rat scrounging for food. Good luck. \n\nI'm sick of always having to search for a safe place to rest, though everyone's displaced these days—since the Last City fell. \n\nI hear the noise again. Louder. Someone's near.\n\nBefore I have the chance to move, they're at the head of my cot.\n\nI swing off of the taut fabric, grab my weapon from the floor, and then roll across the room, blasting Stasis at my assailant. They dodge it entirely, leaving my bed momentarily frozen in time. I fire off rounds, grazing their shoulder. \n\n\"Elsie! Wait!\"\n\nNo one calls me that. Except her.\n\nThe attacker removes her hood. She's changed; a bit worse for wear, but it's her. My stubborn sister.\n\n\"What were you thinking, Ana?! Why did you attack me?\" \n\n\"You attacked me!\"\n\nIt's been years since I've seen her, after the Bombardment. Last family reunion didn't end well. \n\nA crimson line rolls down the length of her arm. \"You're wounded.\" \n\n\"It's nothing. I'll be fine.\" \n\n\"You're not fine. Where is that annoying gnat? Why isn't it fixing you?\"\n\n\"I said it's nothing.\"\n\nSomething's up. I stare through her until she offers an explanation.\n\n\"She's… gone,\" Ana admits begrudgingly. \"Let's leave it at that.\" \n\nI'm not surprised to hear this.\n\n\"What are you doing here, Ana?\"\n\n\"I need you to teach me… show me how to use Stasis, like you. You really understand how to control it. You're not corrupted… like them.\" \n\nShe sounds desperate. That's a bad sign.\n\n\"We've been over this. My answer remains no,\" I say. Ana is smart but too easily lead astray. It's a miracle she ended up how she did. I can't get involved.\n\n\"Every day, I make it by the skin of my teeth. Without the Light, without the Traveler, I'm a sitting Dreg, just waiting to be picked off.\"\n\n\"I have bigger concerns.\"\n\n\"Than family?\" she asks, trying to pull my heart strings. \n\nWon't work. I pick up my bag and head out the door.\n\n\"You're just going to leave? Fine. I'll find someone else to help me learn Stasis, so I can take down Savathûn.\"\n\nAre things really so bad for her that she has this death wish?\n\n\"You know what she did, Ana. Stasis won't save you. This is a suicide mission.\"\n\n\"There are others out there who are tired of living in fear too. We can find them.\"\n\n\"Good. Go talk to them instead.\"\n\n\"Listen to me. We can attack with the Light and Darkness. Together.\"\n\n\"Or we can keep our heads low and move on.\"\n\n\"There's nowhere else to go! You want to run away—that's your choice. But I'm telling you we can do this,\" she says and holds up a satchel, pulling a drive from it. \"We just need a little help.\"\n\n\"You… have him?\" I ask in disbelief.\n\n\"What's left of him.\"\n\nThe Warmind. I guess he didn't vanish with Mars. There is power there, but this is still a foolish plan. Although Ana seems hell-bent on learning Stasis and, with Rasputin, she'll do it. Once she puts her mind to something, there's no stopping her.\n\nI always thought the best way to protect her was to stay away from her. If I push her away now, can I really say I'm doing it for her?\n\n\"Only trouble is, he's stuck on this drive…\" she says knowingly. \"He could use a new vessel.\"\n\nAna smiles at me coyly.

Coming with me, helping me convince Zavala.\" \n\nI admit, it's been inspiring seeing Zavala renewed with purpose, even though he's chosen to keep the ratty beard.\n\n\"I couldn't have come this far without you,\" she finishes. \n\nIt has been nice being with her, despite the circumstances. It's odd having a sister again after all this time.\n\n\"Just doing my part,\" I reply.\n\nAna stares off. I can tell she wants something. So I wait.\n\n\"I need one more thing from you,\" she says.\n\nThere it is.\n\n\"I need you to show me how you use Stasis. Elsie, you're proof that it's not inherently evil. It can be controlled. You show me how, and people will see it's possible.\"\n\nI was hoping we'd moved past this.\n\n\"I'm not a figurehead for some movement, Ana. Stasis isn't something you simply control. There's constant temptation. I struggle still, to this day. Using it takes time. Discipline. And even I still haven't mastered it. Not sure I ever will,\" I say.\n\n\"We will. And when we do, all the deniers will vanish. We'll get our world back. We deserve to get it back.\"\n\n\"We deserve what we got.\"\n\n\"Speak for yourself.

When there was a Vanguard, I thought I had all the answers. Perhaps that was our undoing. I know now that commanding has as much to do with giving orders as it does listening to others' needs.

I am glad to have found you,\" he says.\n\n\"We are in need of all the allies we can find. And you bring the Bray sisters, I see.\"\n\nI bow. \"It's good to see you again, my Queen.\" I learned in my time with her, before everything collapsed, that the Queen is particular about her customs.\n\nMara smiles back at me. \"And you, my friend.\"\n\n\"Where is Calus?\" Zavala asks.\n\n\"We are unsure of his whereabouts. A problem for another day.\"\n\nShe's surrounded by Cabal and Fallen working alongside what's left of the Awoken army. I had heard some defected to Eris after Mara's failed assaults. Everyone has lost so much to the Dark armies. \n\n\"I'm surprised you don't have Vex here as well,\" Ana says discourteously.\n\n\"An attempt at humor, my Queen,\" I say, nudging Ana in the hopes of conveying to her that the Queen expects respect. \n\n\"The Vex are trapped in time by our betrayer and her Dark army,\" Mara says.\n\n\"We have something that we believe can turn the tide,\" Zavala says, gesturing toward Rasputin. \"The Warmind can locate the Traveler using Clovis Bray's tracking algorithm. We know how to capture the Traveler once we find it, but we'll need your army to build the harness.\" \n\n\"I have slowly been gathering forces in preparation of striking back at Eris and the Witch Queen. I would invite you to join our ranks and swear allegiance, but I can smell the aroma of Darkness around you,\" Mara says, her gaze resting on me.\n\n\"My Queen,\" I say, lowering my head, \"I am wielding Stasis, but we want the same end: to survive this.\" \n\nShe's unconvinced. \n\n\"Elisabeth, you once asked me to pick a side, even if it was the wrong one. Tell me, did you choose correctly?\" she asks.\n\n\"I should hope so, since I am at your side once more.\"\n\nMara and Zavala exchange a loaded glance and he nods, offering his approval.\n\n\"Do not mistake my hospitality for trust. You will earn it on the battlefield.\"\n\nI bow again. Ana does not.\n\n\nLater, as I approach the Queen's quarters, I overhear Zavala. \"…have to be aware, I do not fully trust her. I think she has a thirst for Darkness.\" \n\n\"We will do our best to keep a close eye on that one,\" Mara responds.\n\nHow could they still not trust me?\n\n\"If things go south, I'll do it myself. Ana is my friend, after all,\" he replies.\n\nOh. \n\n\"What are they saying?\" Ana whispers, startling me.\n\n\"Nothing. Let's go,\" I say quietly.\n\n\"Is there a spy in our midst?\" Mara calls out. Not quiet enough, I guess.\n\n\"No, ma'am. We were just coming in to talk strategy,\" Ana says as we enter the room. Quick thinking! \"The Leviathan presents some interesting possibilities.\"\n\n\"My forces are constructing the harness as we speak. No matter what advantages you believe we have, we are still underprepared for the threat we face. Eris Morn is powerful in ways even I do not comprehend. She is using the Darkness to its full potential.\"\n\n\"What if we're able to do the same… but with the Light?\" I propose.\n\n\n\nThrough the unending expanse of space, we see a soft light, a beacon. The Traveler.\n\n\"There you are,\" Zavala says to himself as Mara and her makeshift army ready themselves.\n\nAs we approach, I am awestruck. I forgot how massive it is. We have one shot at this.\n\n\"Red says he's able to access some of the ship's higher functions and weaponry. Dormant satellite arrays as well. Could prove useful,\" Ana says.\n\n\"Some good news, finally,\" Zavala exhales. \"Elisabeth…\"\n\nSuddenly, Zavala collapses to the floor, grabbing his head and screaming loud enough to echo through the Leviathan.\n\n\"What happened?\" Mara demands.\n\n\"I don't know! He just fell,\" Ana responds.\n\nHis eyes open wide. He calms. Then he speaks.\n\n\"We need you. Return to us.\"  \n\nIs he? He's speaking… to the Traveler?\n\n\"You chose us before. Please, give us another chance.\"\n\nHe closes his eyes and rubs his head.\n\n\"It intends to run,\" Zavala says, standing and regaining his composure.\n\n\"What are we gonna do?\" Ana asks.\n\nZavala releases a deep, focused breath. \"Take it back. By force.\"\n\n\"Launch the harness!\" Mara Sov commands as her crew gets to work.\n\nIt fires as the Traveler becomes aware, burning with a rich, luminous glow. Too bright to keep staring. I shield my eyes hoping we built this right. \n\nThe Leviathan shakes, and I grab onto the wall to keep from falling. \n\nThe light fades, and my eyes adjust. Sure enough, the harness has latched onto the sphere like a barnacle, the six arms gripped tight. The Leviathan erupts in applause.

From there out, Dark Guardians spawned… and Darkness slowly spread.\" \n\n\"I'm here now.

Even disassembled, the Hive tower was intricate. Multi-layered. Woven metal latticework coiled in ever-tightening concentric cylinders. Each could spin independently within the larger housing. Maddeningly complex armatures were contained within, lubricated by gristly, living tissue.\n\nKosis had marked the Hive salvage specifically for the Spider's attention. It wouldn't be shipped off to marketplaces and storehouses like the remains of the Ketch—finds like this were of special interest to him. Kosis considered sending a missive ahead of the shipment but thought better of it. If she weren't there to present the find herself, another ambitious Vandal or Dreg might try and take the credit. Spider would probably promote the usurper strictly out of appreciation for their cunning.\n\nKosis was so focused on ensuring the safety of her salvage that she hadn't noticed Savek and the other Dregs running into camp from the direction of the cave. Kosis stood, Sword in hand, half-expecting a mutiny. But from the fear in Savek's eyes, Kosis quickly realized it was anything but.\n\n\"It returned!\" was all Savek could exclaim. The Dregs confirmed: the dismantled structure had regrown in a matter of hours. Kosis ordered the trio to lead her back to the site, to see it with her own eyes. A part of her yearned to see it again.\n\nMuch to Kosis's disbelief, their assertion was true. The structure stood as tall as ever, emanating its hideous green light. A pang of dread shook Kosis to the core. Her mind flooded with memories of childhood stories about the Whirlwind and the onslaught of the Hive.\n\n\"Leave it,\" she ordered. \"Leave it and do not return.\" It was a command, though one born of fear.\n\nThe tower whispered an unheard counteroffer into her subconscious.\n\n\u003c\u003cCome.\u003e\u003e\n\n\u003c\u003cSee.\u003e\u003e","icon":"/common/destiny2_content/icons/db653332cc4cb06226061430505cf82e.png"}},"1215310596":{"hash":1215310596,"index":1391,"redacted":false,"name":null,"iconImagePath":null,"colorImagePath":null,"displayProperties":{"name":"III.

Where once only darkness filled the space within its frame, a hint of sickly green light now shone. Tendrils of smoke wafted from the apertures, as though it were an incense brazier.\n\nKosis immediately strode forward and assessed the nodule crowning the surface of the barren rock. As the Vandal knelt beside the structure, she saw deformed latticework-like veins protruding through and eroding the stone, as though the object was grown rather than constructed. Kosis waved the Dregs over.\n\nPressure began to build inside her head, behind her eyes, as the ground rumbled. They sprang back, away from the structure; the artifice sprang to life in turn. It twisted its way out of the ground, spiraling upward and outward, spreading open like a terrible biomechanical flower. Only when the eruption halted did Kosis feel the pressure in her head recede.\n\nIt was undeniably of Hive origin, but Kosis had never seen anything of the sort.

These precautions were meant to deter competing parties from biting the crew's claim, but it was a waste of energy this far out. The foreboding quiet would betray any approaching Pikes.\n\nOnce camp was established, each crew member received an Ether ration commensurate with their station. Savek tried not to hunger as she watched Kosis inhale three full portions of the life-giving essence; more than twice her own share. The Spider had given them just two tanks—partly as a cost-saving measure, and partly as an incentive to get the job done quickly.\n\nLater that night, a crewmate woke Savek from her deep slumber. \"You're late. Northwestern posting. Two-cycle shift,\" the Dreg grumbled. Savek clicked her mandibles in irritation and trudged wearily into the deep violet gloaming of the Shore.\n\nSavek was nestled in her dugout at the top of a wide dune, trying not to fall back asleep, when she heard a faint whisper. An urgent, familiar call from the far side of the dune, away from camp. Savek bolted upright. Maybe someone wandered away from camp. Or maybe, she thought subversively, someone secured a portion of Ether and needs an accomplice. The latter possibility sent her scuttling down the dune.\n\nWhen she reached the bottom of the slope, she found herself alone. Yet the beckoning whisper persisted, voluminous as an explosion and gentle as a caress.

For the Eliksni, finding the wreckage of a Ketch is like finding the ruins of a family home, and all the emotions that come with it. But the societal scars of Eliksni clans have long since vanished, and for those who bend a knee to the Spider in the remote corner of the Reef known as the Tangled Shore, they have lost the privilege of such sentimentality.\n\nA salvage crew was dispatched the week after a small scouting party from the Spider's personal fiefdom spotted the wreckage of a Ketch belonging to the lost House of Kings.

Before we got off the ship, they gave us official BrayTech snowsuits to put on whenever we go outside. The suits are super chunky and hard to walk in, but Papa says there's an extra-thick lining on the inside to protect against the bad ions bouncing down from space nearby. Plus it helps keep us warm. Did you know that at night, it can get as cold as 140 Kelvin? \n\nI wonder why Clovis Bray chose to build Eventide here, when you're over there terraforming Io? Even if you're not finished, it's probably way nicer…\n\nStill, I'm glad we're here. Seeing Papa again made me so happy I almost cried. (I didn't though.) Once, on the way here, I forgot what his face looked like. No matter how hard I tried, I couldn't see it in my mind. It was awful. \n\nHe's grown a beard, so he looks different now. I like it, but Dad said he feels like he's kissing a polar bear. Papa said Dad'll grow a beard too once he discovers how much warmer his face will be. \"Soon you'll have two polar bears for parents, Micah!\"\n\nFor now, I've got a penguin. A plushie, not a real one. I'm too old for plushies, but Papa told me it's from Clovis Bray. \"A souvenir for your soon-to-be arctic adventures!\" Plus it came with this mini version of an ion-shield snowsuit, like the one I have to wear. \n\nIt actually looks pretty cool, so I think I'm going to keep it. \n\nDo you know about polar bears and penguins? Back before you came, they lived on Earth's two poles that had climates a lot like Europa's. But our technology was so inefficient, it was poisoning Earth's air and killing off whole species of animals and plants. Like the opposite of terraforming. \n\nI'm gonna name this penguin Mihaylova after the scientist-aeronaut on Ares One. Do you remember meeting her and Hardy and Qiao? Can you see their faces in your mind?\n\nThat was a long time ago, way before I was born, but you've been around so long, human years must feel like a minute to you. If that's true, then expect to see me (except grown up with a beard) on Io one second after you get this. \n\nI'm still not sure how I'm gonna send my letters to you yet. Maybe they'll let me use a Warsat. I know those are really for high-level threats and stuff, but how many of those can there be?

Because of the snow and the danger from bad ions in the air, almost the whole colony is packed into this one underground building. The only people that get to go outside without special permission are the maintenance people and the Exos.\n\nOh, right! I can't believe I didn't talk about the Exos! They did it, Clovis Bray and Papa and all the BrayTech scientists made real walking, talking, human-shaped AIs! \n\nI even got to see one when Papa was giving us a tour of the colony! It looked so cool and shiny. It even had these awesome glow-lights for eyes! I wanted to talk to it, but Dad said I couldn't be trusted not to ask too many questions, so he went over on his own. Papa told me that's why Dad is here: to talk to the Exos and analyze their \"human-ness.\" \n\nHe also said he thinks I can be trusted, especially when it comes to keeping my excitement to myself. Some people are scared of the Exos. Which I don't get. How can anyone be anything but amazed by them? \n\nPapa laughed when I asked him that. \"You're like me. Always seeking out the new and interesting. We forget to fear what we don't know.\" \n\nBut he didn't laugh long before he got serious. \"Sometimes that can get us into trouble. That's why we have people like Dad to balance us out.\" \n\nThat's when Dad came back, looking kinda worried. He wouldn't tell us anything because of \"doctor-patient confidentiality.\" Which is annoying. That's what he always says! Except this time it doesn't make sense because they're not real patients.\n\nBefore I could point that out, Papa asked if I wanted to peek inside the factory. Which, of course, I did. So we went around to the loading bay to look. I couldn't see much, but it was still cool.  \n\nThis is all supposed to be secret, but I think it's okay if I tell you.

I'm from Mars. But right now, me and my Dad are on our way to join my Papa at a brand-new colony on Europa! Papa is the lead quantum engineer at BrayTech, which basically means he builds super-cool computers. He's so good at it, he gets to work with the Clovis Bray on all the top-secret stuff. He even designed some of Rasputin's hardware! \n\nI hope he shows me what he's working on. He used to do that, back on Mars. \"It'll be a good learning opportunity for you,\" he'd say, \"But only if you promise not to tell anyone.\" And I never have. Even though my friends back home bugged me about Papa's work all the time. \n\nMy old home, I mean. Soon Europa will be my home, and you'll be my new next-door neighbor over on Io!

I don't really get what he'd even do for BrayTech. All he does is ask people how they're feeling over and over again. Maybe they need him to train a Warmind like Dr. Ana Bray did. Only instead of language, he'll teach it how to analyze its dreams. \n\nDad always teases Papa that a human brain is a lot harder to work with than a hard drive. Maybe Papa got him on one of his projects to finally prove him wrong. \n\nWhat do you have: a hard drive or a brain? Are you an AI like Rasputin? Have you ever talked to him?\n\nSorry if these questions are nosy. Dad says I'm super curious and that's okay, I just need to learn when to stop asking questions. Which is pretty unfair since he gets to ask me stuff all the time. Like right now, he asked what I'm writing.

I mean, I was more scared of getting in trouble than anything else. But looking into those eyes was…\n\nSpooky. Almost like being somewhere so dark you can't see your hands in front of your face, though you can feel they're there.\n\nI couldn't look away, even as I heard the other one asking what they should do with me. If it'd be easier if I just went missing.\n\nThen all of a sudden, its eyes went dark, and I fell to the ground. A second later, it collapsed in a sparking metal heap next to me. \n\nI must've started running again. The next thing I remember was coming back to the empty classroom, holding Mihaylova and Calumet, and looking at the penguins that got left behind. Some of them were lying on the floor!  \n\nFor some reason, that made me mad. Maybe I'm too old for plushies, but at least I take care of mine. So I picked out the ones that looked lonely and ran home across the building to hide them under my bed. Then I went back outside to find my class, just as the teachers were counting everyone up. \n\nNo one had even noticed I was gone.\n\nWhich means they don't know who took the penguins either.

Luckily, I have Mihaylova the Penguin to keep me company while I walk aaaaalll the way to the other side of the building for school. \n\nIt's not a school, really. Classroom is more like it. There's only 50 of us kids, so they shoved us all in one room with two teachers, which is how I found out that everyone got a penguin plushie. I feel dumb thinking I was the only one, but also, it's kinda dumb of Clovis Bray to assume babies and big kids would want the same toy. Some of the older kids threw theirs in the recycling chute, but I managed to rescue one. I think I'll call this one Calumet. That's the aeronaut you didn't get to meet because she died on the way to Mars. \n\nThat's the one thing that scares me. Not the Exos or anything else I don't understand.

Some stupid accident wipes me and the rest of my 290 years out.\n\nI read that before the Golden Age, people only lived to 100 years old if they were lucky.

As long as they keep on top of caring for them… but I guess eventually, their hard drives would get erased by cosmic rays. Papa says that doesn't happen for thousands of years. Plenty of time for backups. \n\nLast night, I dreamed I was an Exo. I was standing in the center of a frozen lake in the middle of the night, with no snowsuit, and I didn't feel cold at all. The sky above was completely black, except for one bright moon in the distance. Just as I was looking up, wondering what to do next… Dad woke me up. \n\nAt first I was mad, but he reminded me that dreams are messages from deep inside our minds.

But of course, when we got outside, everyone went running in a bunch of directions. That's when I decided I'd learn more useful stuff over at the Exo factory with Papa and Dad. I didn't break the rules. The factory was in sight, plus I had two buddies: Mihaylova and Calumet. \n\nI knew I couldn't go in the front door without a badge. So I went around the side to the loading bay where there were two Exos unloading a bunch of crates.

Need to or not, this is when we used to have lunch. I refuse to work through lunch.\"\n\nAnd the other one said, \"I miss lunch.

You tell him about the whisper?\"\n\nThat's when I wanted to leave. I didn't like them making fun of Dad. Plus, the way they talked about food and dreams… it made me feel sick.

That we should be able to protect ourselves without relying on you, Traveler. That something more powerful could come along, or you could turn on us.\n\nWhich made me feel sick again. Papa's always told me about how much you've given us, how we should return the favor by learning and exploring and stretching the Golden Age for thousands of more years. But now he was saying…\n\n\"Skip the ethics lecture and tell me: if you knew humanity could be wiped out in the next 50 years, wouldn't you try anything and everything to save us? To save our child?\" \n\nIt got quiet then. For so long that I almost went back to bed when I heard Papa again: \"This DER stuff is hard, but I think the humanisms you suggested are the solution.

I come back to it today in good humor, moved by my Emperor's own amusement. A party of the Guardians that Calus entertains have arrived with a set of various squabbling demands—a starship, a precise description of their \"Darkness,\" a list of stars the Traveler has visited, a treaty with the Cabal empire for the defense of Earth, a chance to see Calus in his true form, repairs to certain weapons that they feel have gone askew, so much and so forth.\n\nCalus loves these Guardians so. He loves them for their energy, their liveliness, their willingness to do whatever he asks in hope of a reward. He loves it when they dance. He loves the great heroic sulks so many of them enter when they become dissatisfied with their work. Seek joy, he urges them!\n\nAnd he loves his Guardians because he knows he can teach them a lesson they cannot ever learn themselves. They are as Calus once was: unaware of their finitude.\n\nCalus will teach them. They are immortal, but they will all be gone one day—like my Emperor, like me. That appointed day is coming soon. All of this will vanish as surely as childhood vanishes from the grown. And when the things the Guardians strive for are lost—their power, their future, their drive to do more and more—they will understand that what matters is the joy they found with their companions, not the arsenals and ambitions they gathered.\n\nAll things will end. All things done for the sake of some future greatness will come to nothing. In our final tallies, only the things that brought us joy and meaning will count.\n\nAnd because I trusted Calus, I have found joy.

The Leviathan's course is set for a far system, where the Traveler awaits. His Shadows are already on their way to kill Ghaul, or to die in the attempt. How could I betray him, in this time of endings, by keeping a secret he has asked to share?\n\nI went to him as he bathed in his royal pool, for his proxies are, of course, as exquisitely sensual as his old form. I shed my garments, there being no more taboo between us than between two animals, and sat beside him in the glow of his comfort.\n\n\"Your Majesty,\" I said, \"I kept a secret from you.\"\n\nI explained how I worshipped my ancestors and the sacred chalice that cupped their spirits. I admitted that I had put these beliefs before him in my heart.

If I were one of the Clipse, I would want a fair chance. Not judgment from on high.\"\n\nHe nodded in compassion. \"I know. I once tried to be fair too, Match. An empire of excess for every citizen, no matter their class or species of birth. It is good for a ruler to raise the standard by which his subjects live. But what if that ruler has found proof, absolute proof, that existence is a zero-sum game? That there is not enough time or energy to give everyone a fair life? Knowing that, mustn't we privilege a chosen few?\"\n\nI did not know and I admitted it.\n\n\"That's all right. I don't ask certainty.\" He shifted himself, sending waves across the pool. \"For a long time after the coup, I stared out into the infinite universe, and I saw... meaninglessness. In a universe that goes on forever, there must be an infinity of Caluses, all staring at the same blankness. How could I be a god if I was... generic?\n\n\"But now that I have seen what is coming, now that there is a limit to the time afforded to us... well, it may sound cruel, Match, but the less there is of everything else, the more I matter. I intend to be the last good thing in this world. I will gather my chosen companions and ease as much suffering as I can before the end. There are emperors who would take on any shape to escape death. I am not one. I am true to myself. And so, Match, are you.\"\n\nHe clapped me on the back with enormous gentleness. \"Your only crime, my councilor, was that you denied me the chance to give you a gift. Come.

One day the Leviathan howls along at speed, and the next it drifts on an idle course. We still cannot repair the butchered control systems, and our Emperor, who once ordered this ship's construction for his purposes, refuses to share his knowledge in metaconcert.\n\nYet as we leave the space that was once his dominion, I see how my Emperor digests his situation. He no longer rages and spills wine. He has not cursed Ghaul's name in nearly a year. I feel his thoughts taking new shape and color.\n\nI do not know if I like it.\n\nIn the fast-time of relativity, we watch the Cabal change around us, and it leaves my eye cold from weeping. When Calus reigned, artists and thinkers visited the athenaeum worlds to be inspired by alien wonders from across and beyond the Cabal. Now the athenaeum worlds are shut. The works they inspired have been replaced by grim assembly-line weapons and the architecture of bunkers. Fountains geyser black fuel; gardens vanish beneath belching factoria.\n\nGhaul has even disfigured the peoples' minds. He has dismembered the Cabal of its foreign influences, teaching the people a pit fighter's gruesome self-sufficiency. Weapons only a grunt can understand. Language that can only be barked through a battlenet. I mourn the empire that built wonders like the Ninth Bridge. I mourn all the client species beaten into cogs.\n\nBut if I mourn, my Emperor withers entirely. Even his interest in the archives and the observatory has vanished—he no longer cares to study a universe that has offended him. He doubts his own divinity, because how could a god allow this to happen? His rage has gone and he does not know what he has left after it. The new shape I feel in his mind is gray and smooth like fog.\n\nAmong my people—I mean my people, the people of the chalice, not the whole Psion species—we call this feeling \"sweet oubliette,\" the shelter that becomes a prison. For Calus, I imagine it feels like the loss of all appetite. Even the curiosity that made him great.\n\nThe councilors ask me to go to him. But I am still afraid. What if he sees my secret? What will he do? Even his beloved tea-seller has already abandoned him.

The astronomers say that an ancient cataclysm blasted open an abscess in the cosmos here. I feel the absence of spirits like a pressure headache, as if everything inside me wants to come rushing out.\n\nWe are all losing hope, but as long as we are still losing it, then it has not run out. Psions are said to have no sense of humor, because humor comes from the unexpected, and we are clairvoyant. Well, we were not clairvoyant enough to expect the coup, so I suppose we must be blind enough to retain a sense of humor, and I can still laugh at our predicament: the loyal retinue of the Curious Emperor, the Emperor of Joyous Excess, marooned in absolute nothingness.\n\nCalus won't leave his observation couch—not to take meals, not to visit gardens or sample the wines, not to read or to write in his Imperativa Titanica or to suggest new dishes to the cooks or to tell us stories from far-away worlds or even to wonder aloud why Caiatl never heeded him. He stares and stares into the emptiness.\n\nI think he feels small. Most of the universe is nothing, and he is nothing to it. This scar in our galaxy was cut long before he was born.\n\nI drew the Y-goblet in the dirt of a garden today. I used my finger, not my mind, so that no one would feel it. My faith was exterminated long before my people met the Cabal, in a way so total and vicious that I do not think a people without psionics could understand the pain.\n\nMy ancestors were the strongest secret-keepers in the universe. I know this because they survived long enough to give birth to me. I don't know how they did it, because every time I look another Psion in the face I see the Y-goblet, the holy cup into which our minds were poured.\n\nWhat if Calus knows I'm losing my faith in him?

My every thought and purpose for my Emperor, Calus, once and future sovereign.\n\nWe are at war. Here at the fringe of the empire, fleets clash over emptiness. In council, we surmise that the tyrant Ghaul wants this void as a buffer against invasion—but isn't the irony bitter? This enemy desires nothing but our death. And so we oblige them by dying for nothing.\n\nIt is the opposite of everything Calus wanted for his people. Even the new Cabal's ships are expendable. These are not the beautiful deterrents of Calus's armada; they are ugly, hasty, and crude. The crews live in their armor, prisoners of their duty, escaping only through music and games smuggled into the battlenet. One popular pastime, I understand, is to draft personal \"fleets\" and \"legions\" from among real Cabal ships and soldiers, competing with comrades to win the most victories. Of course it is very bad luck to draft your own unit.\n\nThe enemy is yet worse. All Psions live in a world of minds. I believe in the cup and all its spirits because I feel those spirits every day—the prints left by other minds on the things I touch and see. These Hive... have no spirit. Their souls are emaciated. Some horrible solvent has stripped them of everything but hate, cunning, and the will to survive. I think they worship death because it is the only salvation from their existence.\n\nI suggested that the War Councilors invite Calus to observe one of Ghaul's carrier groups attacking a Hive war moon. He came because he knows the value of pretending to care. But even the shape of the fleet hurt him; Ghaul and his tyrannical ally Umun'arath have abandoned proud, independent cruisers (instruments of state, Calus liked to say) for swarms of frigates that suckle fuel from enormous fleet carriers. The Hive's portals leave no time or space for elegant vector dances, so these new ships are built for brutal exchanges at point-blank range.\n\nWe felt other Psions at work, hiding the traitor fleet from the Hive as they scattered drills and boarding pods in the war moon's path. A strike at the surface was not enough; someone would have to bring a planet-cracker warhead down into the moon's viscera. Caught up in the excitement, I asked one of the war councilors how we could possibly prevail against the Hive, who were so old and so powerful.\n\nShe compared our Cabal to a seagoing warship and the Hive to a submarine. They might dive into deep metaphysical layers of existence, where we are no match for them. But in the ordinary universe, the Hive are like a submarine on the surface: still dangerous, but not invincibly so.\n\nI was fascinated and secretly struck by the clarity of the goblet on her face. Did she believe we could ultimately defeat the Hive?\n\nNo, she said. But we could hold them back long enough to live our lives. Wasn't that enough?\n\nInviting Calus was a mistake. It only reminded him that he had no power at all.","icon":"/common/destiny2_content/icons/92904fbbef5bcc82030dd818c60d49af.png"}},"1489617036":{"hash":1489617036,"index":1092,"redacted":false,"name":null,"iconImagePath":null,"colorImagePath":null,"displayProperties":{"name":"Entry V","description":"By the mind of Match, Shadow Councilor to the True Emperor.

I should have been vetting a list of loyalists for the countercoup, but in truth, I was watching the ruined mirrors of an ancient starshell as they plummeted four hundred million kilometers into a blue sun. They look like crumpled handkerchiefs. Their fall is very slow, and those who made them are eons dead.\n\nHere on our Leviathan, all is reborn. The guard companies have buffed their armor to a syrupy shine. The ship responds ably to our commands, and we can barely quench its appetite for mass to feed its engines and factories. Music fills the gardens, the gardeners hum along as they trim and weed, and Calus dallies in the kitchens with a pinch of spice, once more unmistakably himself.\n\nI haven't thought into this journal since that day at the edge, when Calus came out of his observation bubble overflowing with joy. \"It's the end,\" he bellowed, giddy as a girl with her first tusks. \"It's magnificent, it's divine, it's more than I ever was! Match, it's the end of everything!\"\n\nHe frightened me. That day frightened all of us—none of us will speak of it, and we do not dare more than the shallowest metaconcert, lest our memories pool into a deadly truth. But in that void, Calus saw his purpose renewed. He guided us to reset the failed navigation system, repair the traitors' sabotage, and retake control. I thought we would hurry back to the homeworld, but Calus no longer seems to pine for his lost throne... or to care at all about the reforms he once championed.\n\nNow we wander the galaxy on an epicurean crusade, sampling a bounty of raw furies and rare delights. All the inquisitiveness and avarice that Calus once poured into government he now extends to his appetites. I have seen Calus feast on things no living mouth can eat. A chill superfluid of helium-4, whorled in his cup for ten years by a single turn of his wrist: he returned a decade later to toss it back. Or a pea of neutronium that should have torn through him like fog. He told me it tasted like the thickest fudge.\n\nHe is changing.\n\nHe was here a moment ago. The ruined starshell caught his attention: He loves beauty, and millions of mirror-bright sails folding up like tissues in wind to fall into a blue giant are very beautiful. Eons ago, someone built these mirrors to hover on the blue star's light, and for a while, I suppose, they lived in sun-fed paradise.\n\n\"How did they die?\" I asked.\n\n\"That, Match, is the wrong question.\" He tuned the observation room to track a single tumbling mirror. In life, the sail had been as wide as the space between a world and its moon; in death, the rigging had collapsed into a thistle of spinmetal and glint. \"What you should ask is why I am so glad they died!\"\n\nI could not imagine, and I admitted it. \"These beings were much like us. They did not travel through time or lacerate the universe and crawl into the wounds or yearn for the patronage of any old machine... they were creatures of material ambition, of physics, of life. If they failed, it is an omen of death for us.\"\n\n\"Precisely,\" Calus said, with wry generosity. \"They were grand once. They thought, very briefly, that they would live forever. And they were wrong. We would be very ungrateful to refuse the lesson, wouldn't we?\"\n\nI sat before a fountain and tried to pour out the spirits for guidance, but they would not explain.\n\n(An addendum, later: I have not seen Calus in the flesh since.)","icon":"/common/destiny2_content/icons/92904fbbef5bcc82030dd818c60d49af.png"}},"1489617037":{"hash":1489617037,"index":1091,"redacted":false,"name":null,"iconImagePath":null,"colorImagePath":null,"displayProperties":{"name":"Entry IV","description":"By the mind of Match—I do not know where we are—chalice catch and save us all—\n\nNothing.\n\nGod answers god!

A star, I found myself thinking, is an explosion that cannot escape the appetite of its own gravity. \"Poor fortune in supernova scattering left this area short of metals, and now there is nothing left but dim stars, dead worlds, and hydrogen.\"\n\n\"A place of poverty,\" he suggested. \"A graveyard.\"\n\n\"You speak often of death, your Majesty.\"\n\n\"The knowledge of death is the key to happiness.\" He patted the bench beside him, as if acknowledging a missing friend. \"Look out there. Imagine all the trillions of beings who lived among these stars. Do you think some of them were happy?\"\n\n\"I should hope so.\"\n\n\"Why, Match? Why would some be happy, and others miserable?\"\n\n\"Perhaps they had more metal,\" I suggested, dryly.\n\n\"Exactly!\" He clapped in delight, nearly bowling me over. \"Happiness is comparative, Match. I tell you that if a rich man lived next to a woman who had ten times his wealth, he would never be satisfied, even in marriage. He would feel poor when he looked at her. Even the basic satisfactions of our biology require contrast—the absence of thirst, the absence of hunger, the absence of loneliness.\"\n\n\"This is a child's philosophy, your Majesty,\" I protested. \"We need pain to know pleasure? We need loss to make us treasure gain? A runt would say these things. Why, you once told me that these are homilies the miserable use to excuse their misery. Suffering does not heighten happiness. Fear does not bless us. True contentment is true in itself.\"\n\nHe looked at me with great satisfaction, delighted by my insight, and by the way my words reflected his own wisdom. \"What was the flaw in my empire, Match? Why did Ghaul overthrow me?\"\n\nI sensed he did not want my first answer: because those disenfranchised and infuriated by his cosmopolitan reforms had united without his knowledge. \"Because you did not fear death, your Majesty?\"\n\n\"Exactly! I opened my arms to embrace all my peoples, offering them consumption without limit and celebration without end. The stars themselves burned sweet and clear, and I forgot—even stars die.\" He leaned closer to me. I felt warmth like an oven under his counterfeit skin. \"You're right. The truly happy do not need misery and suffering to give their lives meaning. They exist in the moment, at peace with their inevitable death. Now that I've accepted all this will end... it has meaning again, Match! I have MORE than the rest of the universe. I've seen what's coming!

When they greeted his return with missiles, it wounded him terribly. But Calus neither sulked nor raged nor signaled them in the dead of their night to woefully demand an explanation.

Then he asked me to deliver an account of Clipse history since the coup.\n\nCalus was proud of his aid to the Clipse. They are—were—trapped in endless war with their alien-infested biosphere, which spawns horrors wherever it grows. Calus saw this war as a regrettable but unalterable fact, so instead of military support, he sought to enrich the Clipse with fine culture and high luxury. The Clipse were not pleased. After Ghaul's mutiny, the Dominus tried to secure their loyalty by sending a fleet group to \"win\" their ancient war.\n\nOf course, the legionaries discovered it was impossible to conquer the xenocidal ecosystem without destroying the planet itself.

After a century of botched climate engineering, toxic shock attacks, and \"clear and hold\" nonsense, Ghaul wrote off the tormented Clipse as \"no longer essential to the strategic security of the empire.\"\n\nI think the Clipse hoped they could win back Ghaul's favor by defying Calus. Perhaps they thought their world was unconquerable. Perhaps they were even right, in the end. Valus Nohr landed on their moon and military capital Kaga-Clipse with just six thousand troops. For eight weeks, the Clipse attacked her by ground and by orbit as their robotic interceptors swarmed the Leviathan. I was not part of the great metaconcert that helped protect us, but the might of gathered minds filled the carpets with static and gave me constant déjà vu.\n\nWhen Nohr broke out of her bastion on her famous thunder run, calling down the Leviathan's missiles on the vital command posts she'd identified, the Clipse defense crumbled. Their last desperate act was a commando strike at the Leviathan itself. The boarding craft slipped under our sensors, but the metaconcert felt the vengeful purpose aboard.\n\nCalus stopped us from firing. \"I welcome their attempt,\" he said. \"Let me see their spirit.\"\n\nI called to ask his intentions—I have not seen him face to face for longer than I can count. \"I'm curating my followers, Match,\" he answered. \"Thinking about the shadows I'll cast.\"\n\nThe Clipse attack failed, of course, but there was a survivor—the one named Rull. Some think he earned a face-to-face meeting with Calus, though I doubt it was truly His Face. With Kaga-Clipse in our control, we could destroy the Clipse world at our leisure. Calus rewarded their surrender by giving Rull a gift: everything the Clipse needed to end their agonizing perpetual war.\n\nIt was a sheet of paper, the thick rough-edged sort that Calus makes out of cometary water and cotton from his personal garden (he says that he likes the smell). Rull signed it after two hours in a room with Calus. The Leviathan's factories shuddered into motion, forging luxurious self-contained arcologies, pocket worlds that could hold thousands in perpetual comfort.\n\nWhen Rull's chosen people were safe in the arcologies, the guns of Kaga-Clipse bombarded the Clipse homeworld into a global firestorm. The chosen survivors in the arcologies would inherit lives of plenty. The rest had the peace of ash. The eternal war was over.\n\nI prayed to the cup in the mirror for answers. But it was Calus who responded.\n\n\"Match.\" He spoke into my mind just as a Psion would. \"I told Rull the truth. Everything is going to end soon. We must accept that. What matters is the joy and companionship we can find before the final moment. Why let billions suffer for a future that will never come? Life with no dignity and no purpose except to go on living isn't life. It's a virus. It's a curse. Better to die than to become like the Hive.\"\n\nRull left his world to journey with us. I wonder if he could not face what he'd done.","icon":"/common/destiny2_content/icons/92904fbbef5bcc82030dd818c60d49af.png"}},"1492796803":{"hash":1492796803,"index":1477,"redacted":false,"name":null,"iconImagePath":null,"colorImagePath":null,"displayProperties":{"name":"Phobos Warden Vest","description":"III\n\nThe silence in Zavala's office was interrupted by a burst of static over the comms.\n\nAsher Mir's nasal voice rang shrilly over the speakers. \"Ikora was unavailable!\" he said impatiently.\n\n\"Asher,\" Zavala said into his comms. \"What have you got for me?\"\n\n\"Oh, just some ravings about how best to handle the encroaching Pyramids, if that sort of thing is of any interest to the Vanguard,\" Asher said.\n\n\"Go on,\" said Zavala.\n\n\"I analyzed the paracausal shockwaves from the Traveler's recent inexplicable pulse.

Share your secrets, for then there will be nothing to fear, and the Darkness will have one less weakness to exploit against us.\nDrifter raises other concerns about our coalition. I sense our allegiance to be a precarious one, each of us out of our element, though we all stand to lose far more than we gain through betrayal. If our dedication to the cause does not waver, we will see the other side of this Collapse.\n\nThe bonds we have formed outside of our alliance must not break. We must continue our efforts to convince those opposed to our work that it will be the foundation for our preservation. Our hope lies in a collective unity, though we must also ensure that none shall inhibit our growth or progress, no matter where the opposition lies. I fear for what that entails. I too have trepidations regarding the path we are on. Even as I feel our power swell, there is still temptation rife with destructive potency in Stasis. What else could it unlock inside of us… \n\nIn these unorthodox times, I look to the Darkness and our enemies. See how it empowers them, while it toys with us? Oryx would never have led the Taken without its guidance. Eramis's army has been a vile, deadly force due to its influence. We should learn from their examples. It will subjugate us all if we allow it, so we must spread our message of balance through the Dark. We must show our control—or we too will be lost in the shadow it casts. Now is the time to rise up and take command. Use its power to eliminate the puppets in its grasp. If we are successful in our instruction, through discipline, Guardians will harness the long-dormant power within, without fear of corruption. They will listen to you, Stranger, as they have before. Be their lodestar for hope.\n\nThat is our path to eradicating those who misuse the Darkness. Through our singular focus and unparalleled strength, our enemies will fall by our hand, and the unending night will give way to a dawn not seen since the Golden Age. \n\nIs that not what we are fighting for?","icon":"/common/destiny2_content/icons/5f3e43b5095b76659ab52863d91f453e.png"}},"1570455215":{"hash":1570455215,"index":1438,"redacted":false,"name":null,"iconImagePath":null,"colorImagePath":null,"displayProperties":{"name":"To the Drifter","description":"Drifter,\n\nWhile your presence is often irritating and your odor repellent, you have proved yourself quite knowledgeable regarding our foes.

But nothing is normal during these times, and I accept any ally willing to see past the antiquated philosophy we have sustained ourselves on for so long.

For this effort to be successful, we must cast aside selfish intentions and find common ground.

She had requested his presence but informed him he would not be allowed inside the Temple. Ridiculous. Why was he here? Siegfried's thoughts were abuzz with distortion. Chaos. He followed Petra's march to the Temple chambers, the satchel of samples gripped tightly in his hand. She must have her reasons.  Her secrets. The stairways seemed endless and Siegfried could not shake the image from the cavern. That macabre ritual. He tried to think of anything else.\n\n\"Are there any other Guardians operating in this area?\" Siegfried questioned.\n\n\"Guardians come and go, but I haven't noticed anything unusual, if that's what you mean.\"\n\n\"Nothing you aren't telling me?\"\n\n\"I have no reason to lie to you, Titan.\"\n\n\"I saw a man.\"\n\nPetra stopped walking.

Entrapment. The helplessness. Pulling strings in their small, little corners. Let them be, watched but undisturbed, and they catch other pests.

The wall. Atop the wall. Perched like a buzzard.\n\nIt was him.\n\nSomething hovered with him, glinting in the light.\n\n\"There he is again!\" barked Siegfried. He flung the door open and leapt without waiting for the skimmer to slow. The Titan soared through the air on Light, surging forward in an electrified dash before sliding into a full sprint.

Post-reset, became a lone raider.\n—Vander-2/3: Rescued from the Great Disaster because reset incapacitated him. Served as City guard post-reset. Ghost destroyed on Luna. (Pre- or post-reset? Do Ghosts protect Exo Guardians from spontaneous reset?) \n—Lilakee-5/6/7: Curious case. Known sufferer of severe DER-related nightmares and outbursts. Commandeered a jumpship and vanished.\n—Selass-7/8: Technician sent to data mine Titan settlements. Reset occurred in return transit. Post-reset, remained research technician assisting Cryptarchs.\n\nThese were Exos that had seemingly rebooted themselves; they had wiped away their own identities and taken a new number. Or had someone else somehow done it for them? Could there be records of some of them outside the archive? Could one or two still be alive?\n\nLakshmi-2 closed her eyes, slowed her breathing, and focused on the dichotomy of her emotions. What she'd discovered felt momentous, but she knew her colleagues would treat it as a curiosity. People often discounted Exos. It was if there were a line between frame and flesh and blood. The idea offended Lakshmi-2, but at the same time, she knew Exos were different enough from normal Humans. The existence of Exos who reset themselves—for whatever reason—proved that.\n\nOr did they?\n\nA quick search of the medical archives turned up ailments and causes considered quackery by the Golden Age: psychogenic amnesia, dissociative fugue, retrograde memory loss, personal obliteration, betrayal theory…\n\nWhat did it all mean?\n\nLakshmi-2 felt uncertain, and that always boded ill.","icon":null}},"1953865369":{"hash":1953865369,"index":1512,"redacted":false,"name":null,"iconImagePath":null,"colorImagePath":null,"displayProperties":{"name":"Calamity Rig Plate","description":"How do you feel about all this, hero?\n\nYou've got a dead heart beating in your chest right now.

I was led to believe that top minds would be assembled in a collective effort to cure [REDACTED]. That was a lie. I am requesting safe passage to Earth and to be removed from the [REDACTED]. [REDACTED] has demonstrated he is incapable of empathy and will travel to the furthest reaches of our solar system to avoid legal ramifications to pursue his twisted vision. I quickly discovered his endeavor was less of a colony and more of a cult: you are either with him or against him. I was once his closest confidant. Now I hardly recognize him.\n\nHis experiments have become deranged and torturous, all while he maintains the calm lucidity of a sociopath. It is my opinion that his research and assets be frozen, so he can be retrieved and dealt a swift, unflinching justice. He is compromised and is being manipulated. To describe what I've witnessed would be a gratuitous exercise in horror, but I fear without clear circumstantial accounts, there will be no action.\n\nOne case recklessly and viciously cost a young man, [REDACTED] , the loss of his motor skills and, eventually, his life. The notion of downloading a human consciousness for preservation is not new, but an effective and nonlethal means of doing so has yet to be presented. After months of trials with brain scans that proved they were not comprehensive enough to provide more than a memory bank, [REDACTED] obsession grew. He wanted the bank to achieve [REDACTED] and [REDACTED]. He was seeking the [REDACTED]. It rapidly became clear that his intentions were dubious. [REDACTED] brain was scanned beyond legal standards, and his exposure to radiation incited the accelerated growth of a tumor that impaired his cognitive function. He was moribund and should have been released from this experiment.\n\n[REDACTED] insisted this was a small hurdle, and [REDACTED] had been our most lucrative candidate, so all efforts went toward the removal of his tumor. That was when I was made aware of the milky [REDACTED] substance. He was farming the [REDACTED] that passed through the [REDACTED] he constructed under mysterious guidance for their [REDACTED]. I suspect he intends to [REDACTED], so he can close the [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] his converts to [REDACTED] directly from them. Here is the proof:\n\nWe started with injections in moderate doses under heavy surveillance. Remarkably, the tumor began to recede, and some functions were restored. He was prescribed more injections. Suddenly, he was being force-fed liters in hopes of reversing all the damage he suffered. At first we believed we stumbled onto a cure-all miracle, but soon the ramifications of our unnatural meddling reared their ugly heads. His body chemistry changed—he was overrun with new elements foreign to our periodic table. He was becoming a [REDACTED]; the [REDACTED] was [REDACTED]. The mutilation he endured as [REDACTED] replaced [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] replaced [REDACTED] was beyond the ethical code of conduct and against the moral fibers that bind us. He grew strong, violent, and incomprehensible. He was a threat to us all and was terminated after an attack where two colleagues fell victim to an outburst.\n\nThis is one case of hundreds. Past dictators have committed [REDACTED] that pale in comparison, and this was never anything more than a quest for his own ego and [REDACTED].  I fear this is only the beginning. It is a tame display compared to what [REDACTED] is capable of. It is paramount you act quickly and decisively. These experiments will lead to large-scale ruin far beyond Europa.

The entranced Servitor had dimmed, and foul-smelling liquid spilled from punctures and rutted gashes in its plating. Trihn looked the machine over curiously. It was an oddity this far from the Shore, and to be left unprotected was even stranger.\n\nToppled in the dirt, an Arc spear tip drew her eye to an open case of digging tools, high-tensile strength line, and respirator filters— and just beyond: the wheezing Captain. Trihn scooped the spear from the ground and walked the few short steps to him.\n\n\"What name do you go by, cur of Driksys?\" Her Eliksni was of the Shore, a crudeform result of the elegant language diluted by Sol-domestic phrases and pronunciations.\n\nThe Captain thrashed and rolled onto its back, snapping quills like kindling. It propped itself on rough-hewn fleshy stubs to extend its reach and swiped at her with its single remaining arm. Froth spilled from its cracked mask, and underneath a broken section at the brow-line, a maddened eye fixated on her.\n\n\"What's wrong with him?\"\n\n Shakto materialized at Trihn's side. \"I don't know. Presenting physiology is Fallen, but altered. Something in the Ether?\"\n\n\"Whatever they called you, your life is mine now.\" The Lightbearer drove the Arc spear into the Captain's chest with one measured thrust. \"We'll keep doing this until he has no subordinates. He'll be forced to deal with us eventually.\"\n\nTrihn swiped a spent Ether canister from the Captain and held it up to the light. \"Shakto.\"\n\n\"Looks clean to me,\" the Ghost said after a focused scan.\n\nTrihn tossed the canister to shatter on the ground and moved back to the unopened crates. She cracked off one of the lids with the spear and set both aside. Just short of a dozen full fragile vials containing delicate blue jostled within soft packaging. Save a few with froth percolating through worn seals, the Ether swished like plasma-fluid surf inside the glass. \"They wouldn't leave this much unattended.\"\n\nShakto followed the dirt-dragged trail back from the Captain to a curve in the stony walls of the gulley. The trail led him to a narrow separation in the rock face. \"Trihn.\"\n\nIt was enough space to contort her body through. Scrapes ran from the edges of the split into a slithering dark tunnel. Trihn took a stone from the ground and rolled it in her hands, coaxing condensed smoothness from it with palms of Void-Light. She flicked the glowing sphere into the separation and watched it roll a few meters along a line before it skipped over the edge and fell steeply out of sight.\n\n\"You think it fell straight through the Reef?\"\n\n\"I'd say no. That rope goes somewhere.\"\n\nTrihn squeezed shallow breaths into her lungs with each shuffling step. It was all the stone pressing on her ribs would allow. She closed her eyes to keep instinctual panic in check and lurched forward with a final step to meet the precipice. The walls opened; her lungs filled. Line dangled beneath her feet. She grabbed the line and tested the solidity of the ground-spike holding it in place.\n\n\"Shakto, I'm going down.\"\n\nSeveral meters deep in the darkness, buzzing spelunking lights set a grizzly scene aglow. Three Vandals, two Dregs, and a Captain lay slain and lifeless and ripped agape—some residually twitching from Arc blade cuts. Near the Captain, two severed arms bled pools. A third arm, prosthetic, was pinned to an adjacent stone wall with a spear. Her breath trembled. She knew this violence.

His sense of touch is good; there's certainly enough circuitry in his metal fingers to pull off the most precise of shots. But even a hair-trigger touch might rip the brittle paper… \n\nCayde pauses on a page. \"If sailor tales and sailor tunes, storm and adventure, heat and cold—\"\n\nSuddenly, a gust of surprisingly icy wind nearly rips the book from Cayde's hands. \"To hell with this godforsaken ice cube!\" he shouts, almost falling from his perch. \n\nHe steadies himself and inhales deeply. Hang on there, Cayde. You're not on any ice cube, godforsaken or otherwise.

The snow-white plains of a distant moon, a sarcophagus of ice and iron.\n\n—flash—\n\nYes, that's what Europa feels like to Cayde-1 as he loads crate after crate onto the bay outside the Exoscience factory. Even the sky has turned a flat gray, casting all beneath it in dull, deadening light. A warning sky, he thinks. Sailors had some kinda rhyme for it, didn't they?\n\nEither way, it hardly makes for a motivating work environment. Cayde sits on one of the crates. \"I'm taking a break,\" he announces. \"Need to or not, this is when we used to have lunch. I refuse to work through lunch.\"\n\nNext to him, Knox-4 sighs with relief and longing. \"I miss lunch. I miss getting hungry.\"\n\nCayde grins as much as his mechanical face will allow. \"Hmm…\" he intones in his best Dr. Abrams impression, \"So you would say… you're hungry for hunger?\"\n\nKnox bursts into guffaws. Cayde chuckles weakly. It wasn't that funny. But as his friend's laughter grows, so does Cayde's. Soon, they're both clutching each other and howling. \n\nThen, gradually, their cheer fades. \"What do you tell that shrink, by the way?\" Knox asks. \"You tell him about the whisper?\"\n\nCayde shakes his head. Before he can snark about the uselessness of psychologists, the whisper rings in his metal skull. It's red sky in morning, sailor's warning.

He rifles through the piles of loot, until… \"Aha!\" He finds a pen. Cayde-6 isn't done yet.

Among the most relevant such figures is Dominus Ghaul himself, who appears to have a personal affinity for the Acrius myth. \n\nI must also note here that, while linguistic analysis of the Cabal language and its many dialects is incomplete, they do not appear to have a word for the concept of \"hubris.\" \n—Research notes of Tyra Karn","icon":null}},"3592548938":{"hash":3592548938,"index":72,"redacted":false,"name":null,"iconImagePath":null,"colorImagePath":null,"displayProperties":{"name":"Robes of the Fulminator","description":"The charred husk that was Statesman Tha'uul had revealed several things before he expired.
