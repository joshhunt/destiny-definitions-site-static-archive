She heard clarity in the purring mirth emitting from the stone. Three times she had done this, the last leaving several fractures in the bones of her hands. The stone played out her vengeance in a thousand different ways. She studied each path that left Driksys dead and forgotten. She studied those that showed her failure. But there were gaps, and she always needed more. Trihn drew upon the second vial with her golden needle.\n\nIt struck as if bottled lightning. She peeled back the layers. She witnessed it, knew now that the onyx stone had not risen, but was thrust into the floor like a plunging blade. A bannerette in claim. A needlepoint finger. It sold the simple answers in exchange for mental frippery, the unused space between thoughts. A buried name to be revealed.\n\nSuggesting,\n\nthen asking,\n\ninsisting,\n\nimpellent.\n\nEmbedded.\n\nIt tore her consciousness across the cosmos to a grand terrace of onyx Swords, hilted in emerald flame and overlooking darkened systems. A glint in the distance. A world? A name? A promise offered and dragged in Sisyphean humor as voices from the black edges of space converged in laughter. A lone figure stood on the terrace aside two empty thrones. A host of mouths split down the centerline of its form. They screamed with countless voices. Their harmonious epiphany dragged the buried name from the depths, from the pit, from the heap, to the surface.\n\nIt was the only truth before her, and with it, Trihn drowned in regret.\n\nTrihn opened her eyes to Shakto nudging her head. It took every ounce of restraint to keep her blade sheathed. It was the fright, she thought. She hadn't expected him.\n\n\"You were muttering a name.\" He waited for her response.\n\nShe sat up in the dim cavern before the cryptolith and quickly scooted back several paces. Her muscles ached and every small motion splintered pain through torn tendons and micro-fractured bones beneath her skin.\n\n\"What?\" A pulsing irritant was raging inside her head. It wasn't the Ether. This was different.\n\n\"Do you remember the name?\" Shakto moved back to her side and began restoring her injuries.\n\n\"Something is coming here.\" Trihn turned to her Ghost. \"I don't.\"\n\n\"Xivu Arath.\" Shakto saw no recognition in his Lightbearer's eyes, but Trihn felt the name nestle into the small unused crevices of her mind. It had taken hold.\n\nIn the day's journey back to the mainland of the Shore, the name would spread, making war on her thoughts. Trihn would dream of Driksys, always, only to awaken with dug-in fingernails drawing blood from her palms or to find herself alone wailing into the night on some desolate mote of rock. She had been separated from Shakto twice like this before they found a remedy: death. Revival kept the name at bay, but only for so long. She came to know the name through its persistence. Xivu Arath. It would knock her down many times, but she had always found the ritual of righting oneself uplifting. This would not bury her, for she still had much to do.","icon":null}},"370712896":{"hash":370712896,"index":1364,"redacted":false,"name":null,"iconImagePath":null,"colorImagePath":null,"displayProperties":{"name":"Salvation's Grip","description":"[in winding Eliksni script:] This power bestowed by the Dark was given first to the Eliksni—not to the machine-children, who are unlucky second-borns, unstoried and short in their memories.

It wasn't clear to Gaelin-4 where exactly wind was generated in the Reef, but it howled just the same. The three huntsmen lay on tattered mats in the dirt, backs to each other and the sky, in a triad. From two of their backs: matte black quills bent in the wind. The third's back was shrouded under a faded tan cloak, tent-poled by the quiver extending from his Orpheus Rig hip plate. Their vehicles: lashed down under camouflaged covers.\n\nShimmering flames licked the interior of the burnt-out transport. The engine oil they used for fuel turned the blaze a violet hue.\n\n\"I'll draw it to the Void tether. Once it's snared, we can spring your Arc-cage.\"\n\n\"The Guardian does not want Web Mines?

All is made well,\" Nivviks said.\n\n\"Do you know who that man back there was, in your Spider's lair?\"\n\n \"No,\" Vynriis answered.\n\n\"Do not care.\" Nivviks added.\n\n\"Osiris. You should know. Ever heard of Six Fronts?\"\n\n\"Many times, from Guardians who speak of little else than their victories.\" Nivviks adjusted his posture.\n\n\"I think I can speak to it. I was there,\" said Gaelin.\n\n\"I was not,\" interjected Vynriis. \"Vynriis knows only the Shore.\"\n\n\"Do they tell you all Fallen died that day? No Guardians? Convenient,\" Nivviks cackled.\n\nGaelin-4 rolled to his side to look at Nivviks. \"You saying otherwise?\"\n\nNivviks turned to face him. \"Yes. I remember the fronts. I remember Red War. I remember Earth. I remember Riis. I remember before the Great Machine lifted you up.\"\n\nVynriis listened to the two without moving.\n\n\"You're older than I thought. I'm sure you'd agree things were simpler then. You knew who was good, and who was bad. I miss those times. Now… it's a mess.\"\n\n\"Simple?\" Nivviks laughed in Gaelin's face. \"Life was never simple, but suffering makes the mind narrow. Changes what we see. Survival makes many enemies.

Something isn't right.\"\n\n\"Weren't you just advocating that I listen to her?\"\n\n\"I wanted to see if something was off with you as well.\"\n\n\"You're a bastard,\" I seethe. \n\n\"I'm making sure we're successful.\"\n\n\"You wouldn't even be here if it weren't for her.

For all our sakes,\" he says.\n\n\nThe Leviathan is quiet. Not the atmosphere of a rallied army charging headfirst on to victory. This feels like a death march. It's not my place to rouse the crowd, so I stand next to Ana and watch as we approach the Moon, the Traveler locked in tow within the harness.\n\n\"Everyone knows their part. I would like to say that I will see you all again on the other side, but we know that isn't true. That's not why we are here. We are here to stop Eris Morn, at all costs,\" Zavala says. \n\nHe and Mara exchange a glance and a nod. He walks past us without another word, past the Cabal and Fallen. Guess he doesn't like goodbyes, either.\n\n\"We have arrived. Ready yourselves,\" the Queen orders. \"Make no mistake: Eris will die this day.\"\n \nWe rush into the drop ships, leaving Rasputin to pilot the Leviathan. I join Ana and Mara on our journey to the surface. \n\n\"Ana… for all those years, I did what I had to do. But I am sorry it was at the expense of us,\" I say. \n\n\"Save it for after. We're gonna win.\"\n\nThe drop ship hits the ground with a thud, sending tremors through me. The door opens, and we're greeted with a frontal assault of Thrall. We come out firing. It's chaotic, but through the turmoil, I spot the Scarlett Keep. I see Eris Morn, drawing power from beneath the surface, and I see an army of Dark Guardians stampeding toward us.\n\nI look up to the Leviathan and the Traveler, aglow in a phosphorescent haze. He's doing it. Zavala is overcharging himself with Light, siphoning from the Traveler using Ghaul's plans and tech. Good luck, Commander, and thank you.\n\nAna and Mara fight through the Hive mercilessly as the Dark Guardians approach. I find Ana and signal toward Eris. In lockstep, we carry out our assault. Ana opens fire on a Hunter while I cover her, blasting a flanking Ogre with Stasis. Ana drops a grenade under its massive feet, and a second later, it's dust. Eris spots us, and I swear she's smiling. From behind the Keep, a full brigade of the Awoken armada rises, perverted with Hive thorns and insignia. \n\nNow's the time, Warmind. \n\nAs the Awoken defectors fire onto the battlefield, they're blasted out of the sky by satellite arrays in a dazzling display. I can feel Eris's frustration at this. Then I see her, shrouded in Darkness, performing a summoning ritual. \n\nA singular beam of blinding Light tears through the black sky with the velocity of a shooting star, headed straight for the Scarlett Keep. \n\nGive 'em hell, Commander. \n\nHe collides with the structure so precisely that he only creates a small fissure. After a moment, an explosion, bright and disastrous, completely levels the Keep to rubble. We hear a deafening scream throughout the field that could only be Savathûn. Mara races to us. \"The Witch is weakened. We strike now!\" \n\nEris is regaining her footing as we close in. \"All of my detractors in one place. Thank you for bringing them to me, Ana,\" she says and smiles. \n\nI turn to Ana, confused. She pulls out a knife and readies it toward Mara. I make a move to stop her, but I can't. I'm frozen in place… by Ana. She stabs Mara Sov in front of us. \"You're welcome, my Queen.\" Stasis and blood drip from her hands. \n\n\"We are all Dark, eventually,\" Eris says with glee.","icon":"/common/destiny2_content/icons/ac05c474541917635ca7bc1ebc995ff8.png"}},"582234691":{"hash":582234691,"index":1433,"redacted":false,"name":null,"iconImagePath":null,"colorImagePath":null,"displayProperties":{"name":"Chapter 9: The Return","description":"\"What have you done?!\" I scream as Mara Sov's body drops lifelessly to the ground.\n\n\"Elsie, listen to me.

Don't you want to be a family again?\"\n\nNot like this. Not through death and betrayal. Zavala was right about her… I remember the promise I made. \n\n\"I forgive you for all the years you kept me in the dark. I know you were trying to protect me. Forget the past. We can start over. Let me protect you now,\" she says with such sincerity that I know she's too far gone to reason with.\n\nThe look on Ana's face tells me she knows where I've landed. She's genuinely hurt, gritting her teeth to stop herself from crying. I try to raise my hand to blast her, but she's already on the move.\n\nAna attacks and stabs me in my side, disconnecting core components. My left arm goes limp. I look up to see Eris summoning a portal. The Vex come flooding through. Our army of Cabal and Fallen are being eviscerated. Vex Hydras swarm the Leviathan and open fire. If I could cry, I would. We lost. Again.\n\nSuddenly, Eris stands above me with a twisted grin. \"Do you see what the path of the self-righteous yields? You call it protection, but all Ana felt was abandonment. You left a void. Darkness filled it.\"\n\n\"You have bigger problems,\" I say, looking to the sky.\n\nA piercing noise emanates from the Traveler. Its brilliance begins to swell. Worried and confused, Eris commands all her forces to focus on killing it with Dark energy.\n\n\"It didn't have to be this way,\" Ana cries as she drives the knife into me once more. \"You could have been with me!\"\n\nI finally shatter my own binding, blasting her with Stasis. She flies back, locked in the air. I see her struggling. \"Ana, she's corrupted you!\" \n\n\"No… She gave me purpose!\" \n\nDamn it all. I know what I have to do. \n\nI kiss her forehead as I turn her blade and thrust it into her. Her eyes go wide, and some semblance of my sister returns before she fades. \n\n\"Elsie…\" she trails off into the void. My own sister… Eris will pay for this. \n\nThe Darkness energy Eris manipulates canvases the landscape and makes its way to the sky. I see the Traveler, getting brighter as the Darkness encapsulates it. I race toward Eris, but I'm too late. \n\nIn an enchanting explosion, the Traveler's Light enshrouds all in totality. \n\nThen darkness. n\nI'm awake. \n\nI see a tower. THE Tower.\n\nI'm in the Last City. It's… thriving. Bustling with life. Children laughing.\n\nThere's a small parade. I fight through the crowd to find Cayde-6 at the center of it. \"I think I finally got him this time!\" he shouts as a beardless Zavala greets him. \n\n\"Taniks has been dead before,\" Zavala says. \n\nFrom behind him emerges Ikora Rey, like a vision. \"Let the new Hunter Vanguard bask. He's earned it.\"\n\nI'm so sick of this scene. Of hearing these words ever since the day I killed my sister. That was the first time. Now I've lost count. \n\nNo matter what I do, it always ends the same. Blood and betrayal. Then I'm back where I started. Right here.\n\nI'm being taunted, punished.

Eramis's siege before the Bombardment sure left its mark on the place. She found Darkness here and helped spread it like a plague on the world. Clovis almost did the same in his time.\n\n\"If I remember right, we have a long drop ahead of us. You better hang on to me,\" I say.\n\nShe wraps her arms over my shoulders, and it's the first time I've been close to a person in over 100 years. I can smell a trace of sodium tallowate. But only a trace. She hasn't bathed for a few days. She squeezes tight. I forgot what this felt like. My body produces a fleeting sensation of warmth. \n\nI move down the elevator shaft. We land as quietly as possible, remaining still. It's dead down here, but the power is on. Someone must have been here… or still is.\n\nAs we make our way through the eviscerated research center, I notice Ana taking it all in.

We need to keep going,\" I say. \n\nShe snaps back to reality. \"Sorry.\"\n\nFinally, we find it. The place where Exos were born. Ana covers her nose as we're greeted with a rotten smell. Slowly, we turn the corner and see a decomposing corpse desperately clinging to a lever on a console. \"The Drifter…,\" Ana says. Hard to tell how long he's been here. We pry his hand from the console and carry him out of the room to try and purge the stench. \n\n\"What do you think he was doing here?\" I ask.\n\n\"Most likely the same thing we are,\" Ana says, plugging in her drive. \"But he failed. Probably for the best. He doesn't deserve another chance.\"\n\nIt's depressing, seeing him like that. All alone down here…\n\nAna works the console. \"Uploading now. Should be out of here soon.

I catch Ana staring at the spot where we found the Drifter's body.\n\n\"You ever think about what we could have done differently?\" she poses.\n\nAll the time. \n\n\"Not really,\" I answer.\n\n\"So much of this death and destruction stems back to us, to our family. I know Clovis was responsible for a lot. He had a hand in bringing the Darkness to this world.\"\n\n\"How do you know that?\" I ask.\n\n\"I found a journal the last time I was here. It's old, and half the pages were torn out, but it had a lot of information about him that was salvageable.\"\n\nOf course, she's been here before. Clearly, she's not telling me the whole truth.\n\n\"What else was in it?\" I ask.\n\n\"Outside of the redacted memos and experiments, there were stories and recollections of our family. It's all from his perspective, so he was never the villain. But still, maybe he wasn't as bad as we thought. He seemed to care about us, in his way.\" \n\n\"Really?\" \n\n\"He did some good, Elsie.\" \n\n\"I was there, Ana. I saw the things he did. He was delusional. Of course, he was never the villain in his own story.\"\n\nWe sit for a while and wait in silence. \n\nThe pool begins to bubble. Ana jumps to her feet as a sleek metal hand emerges from the fluid. Slowly, the Exo rises. Silky liquid drips from the tendrils that conjoin the parts. Eventually, it takes its first steps out of the pool. \n\n\"Red?\" Ana asks timidly. \n\nIts head turns. Glowing eyes of scarlet meet ours, and it speaks… Russian. \n\n\"Welcome back, old friend,\" Ana says. \n\nWe're in business.","icon":"/common/destiny2_content/icons/ac05c474541917635ca7bc1ebc995ff8.png"}},"582234697":{"hash":582234697,"index":1427,"redacted":false,"name":null,"iconImagePath":null,"colorImagePath":null,"displayProperties":{"name":"Chapter 3: Towerless","description":"I keep thinking about the Drifter in the basement of the Deep Stone Crypt and wondering when that will be me.

Buildings leveled and edifices stripped of their vibrancy pollute what was once the last vestige of hope humankind had. The commerce, the children, the bustling life—all gone. Difficult to think about that day. The Bombardment. We were hit on all sides. Eramis, the Cabal, Savathûn, all attacking our strongholds at once. We never recovered. When the Dark Guardians turned on Eramis and the Cabal, everyone who wasn't killed went into hiding. \n\nRasputin says something in Russian that I miss, and Ana laughs.

Before us stands the once proud Commander of the Vanguard, disheveled, in rags. His ghastly white beard is as thick as a steel door. And from the looks of him, a gentle breeze would knock him off his crutch and one remaining leg. They must have taken his Ghost too. Sad to see the deterioration of a body that's been stripped of its Light.\n\n\"Commander! You're alive!\" Ana exclaims.\n\nHe doesn't lower his rifle.\n\n\"It's me… Ana…,\" she says with hurt in her voice.\n\nHis expression never changes.\n\n\"We have a plan to take down Savathûn.

Someone's near.\n\nBefore I have the chance to move, they're at the head of my cot.\n\nI swing off of the taut fabric, grab my weapon from the floor, and then roll across the room, blasting Stasis at my assailant.

You really understand how to control it. You're not corrupted… like them.\" \n\nShe sounds desperate. That's a bad sign.\n\n\"We've been over this. My answer remains no,\" I say. Ana is smart but too easily lead astray. It's a miracle she ended up how she did. I can't get involved.\n\n\"Every day, I make it by the skin of my teeth. Without the Light, without the Traveler, I'm a sitting Dreg, just waiting to be picked off.\"\n\n\"I have bigger concerns.\"\n\n\"Than family?\" she asks, trying to pull my heart strings. \n\nWon't work.

A problem for another day.\"\n\nShe's surrounded by Cabal and Fallen working alongside what's left of the Awoken army. I had heard some defected to Eris after Mara's failed assaults. Everyone has lost so much to the Dark armies. \n\n\"I'm surprised you don't have Vex here as well,\" Ana says discourteously.\n\n\"An attempt at humor, my Queen,\" I say, nudging Ana in the hopes of conveying to her that the Queen expects respect. \n\n\"The Vex are trapped in time by our betrayer and her Dark army,\" Mara says.\n\n\"We have something that we believe can turn the tide,\" Zavala says, gesturing toward Rasputin. \"The Warmind can locate the Traveler using Clovis Bray's tracking algorithm.

Quick thinking! \"The Leviathan presents some interesting possibilities.\"\n\n\"My forces are constructing the harness as we speak. No matter what advantages you believe we have, we are still underprepared for the threat we face. Eris Morn is powerful in ways even I do not comprehend. She is using the Darkness to its full potential.\"\n\n\"What if we're able to do the same… but with the Light?\" I propose.\n\n\n\nThrough the unending expanse of space, we see a soft light, a beacon.

He just fell,\" Ana responds.\n\nHis eyes open wide. He calms. Then he speaks.\n\n\"We need you. Return to us.\"  \n\nIs he? He's speaking… to the Traveler?\n\n\"You chose us before. Please, give us another chance.\"\n\nHe closes his eyes and rubs his head.\n\n\"It intends to run,\" Zavala says, standing and regaining his composure.\n\n\"What are we gonna do?\" Ana asks.\n\nZavala releases a deep, focused breath. \"Take it back. By force.\"\n\n\"Launch the harness!\" Mara Sov commands as her crew gets to work.\n\nIt fires as the Traveler becomes aware, burning with a rich, luminous glow. Too bright to keep staring.

Even disassembled, the Hive tower was intricate. Multi-layered. Woven metal latticework coiled in ever-tightening concentric cylinders. Each could spin independently within the larger housing. Maddeningly complex armatures were contained within, lubricated by gristly, living tissue.\n\nKosis had marked the Hive salvage specifically for the Spider's attention. It wouldn't be shipped off to marketplaces and storehouses like the remains of the Ketch—finds like this were of special interest to him. Kosis considered sending a missive ahead of the shipment but thought better of it. If she weren't there to present the find herself, another ambitious Vandal or Dreg might try and take the credit. Spider would probably promote the usurper strictly out of appreciation for their cunning.\n\nKosis was so focused on ensuring the safety of her salvage that she hadn't noticed Savek and the other Dregs running into camp from the direction of the cave. Kosis stood, Sword in hand, half-expecting a mutiny. But from the fear in Savek's eyes, Kosis quickly realized it was anything but.\n\n\"It returned!\" was all Savek could exclaim. The Dregs confirmed: the dismantled structure had regrown in a matter of hours. Kosis ordered the trio to lead her back to the site, to see it with her own eyes. A part of her yearned to see it again.\n\nMuch to Kosis's disbelief, their assertion was true. The structure stood as tall as ever, emanating its hideous green light. A pang of dread shook Kosis to the core. Her mind flooded with memories of childhood stories about the Whirlwind and the onslaught of the Hive.\n\n\"Leave it,\" she ordered. \"Leave it and do not return.\" It was a command, though one born of fear.\n\nThe tower whispered an unheard counteroffer into her subconscious.\n\n\u003c\u003cCome.\u003e\u003e\n\n\u003c\u003cSee.\u003e\u003e","icon":"/common/destiny2_content/icons/db653332cc4cb06226061430505cf82e.png"}},"1215310596":{"hash":1215310596,"index":1391,"redacted":false,"name":null,"iconImagePath":null,"colorImagePath":null,"displayProperties":{"name":"III.

Where once only darkness filled the space within its frame, a hint of sickly green light now shone. Tendrils of smoke wafted from the apertures, as though it were an incense brazier.\n\nKosis immediately strode forward and assessed the nodule crowning the surface of the barren rock. As the Vandal knelt beside the structure, she saw deformed latticework-like veins protruding through and eroding the stone, as though the object was grown rather than constructed. Kosis waved the Dregs over.\n\nPressure began to build inside her head, behind her eyes, as the ground rumbled. They sprang back, away from the structure; the artifice sprang to life in turn. It twisted its way out of the ground, spiraling upward and outward, spreading open like a terrible biomechanical flower. Only when the eruption halted did Kosis feel the pressure in her head recede.\n\nIt was undeniably of Hive origin, but Kosis had never seen anything of the sort.

These precautions were meant to deter competing parties from biting the crew's claim, but it was a waste of energy this far out. The foreboding quiet would betray any approaching Pikes.\n\nOnce camp was established, each crew member received an Ether ration commensurate with their station. Savek tried not to hunger as she watched Kosis inhale three full portions of the life-giving essence; more than twice her own share. The Spider had given them just two tanks—partly as a cost-saving measure, and partly as an incentive to get the job done quickly.\n\nLater that night, a crewmate woke Savek from her deep slumber. \"You're late. Northwestern posting. Two-cycle shift,\" the Dreg grumbled. Savek clicked her mandibles in irritation and trudged wearily into the deep violet gloaming of the Shore.\n\nSavek was nestled in her dugout at the top of a wide dune, trying not to fall back asleep, when she heard a faint whisper. An urgent, familiar call from the far side of the dune, away from camp. Savek bolted upright. Maybe someone wandered away from camp. Or maybe, she thought subversively, someone secured a portion of Ether and needs an accomplice. The latter possibility sent her scuttling down the dune.\n\nWhen she reached the bottom of the slope, she found herself alone. Yet the beckoning whisper persisted, voluminous as an explosion and gentle as a caress.

For the Eliksni, finding the wreckage of a Ketch is like finding the ruins of a family home, and all the emotions that come with it. But the societal scars of Eliksni clans have long since vanished, and for those who bend a knee to the Spider in the remote corner of the Reef known as the Tangled Shore, they have lost the privilege of such sentimentality.\n\nA salvage crew was dispatched the week after a small scouting party from the Spider's personal fiefdom spotted the wreckage of a Ketch belonging to the lost House of Kings.

A plushie, not a real one. I'm too old for plushies, but Papa told me it's from Clovis Bray. \"A souvenir for your soon-to-be arctic adventures!\" Plus it came with this mini version of an ion-shield snowsuit, like the one I have to wear. \n\nIt actually looks pretty cool, so I think I'm going to keep it. \n\nDo you know about polar bears and penguins? Back before you came, they lived on Earth's two poles that had climates a lot like Europa's. But our technology was so inefficient, it was poisoning Earth's air and killing off whole species of animals and plants. Like the opposite of terraforming. \n\nI'm gonna name this penguin Mihaylova after the scientist-aeronaut on Ares One. Do you remember meeting her and Hardy and Qiao? Can you see their faces in your mind?\n\nThat was a long time ago, way before I was born, but you've been around so long, human years must feel like a minute to you. If that's true, then expect to see me (except grown up with a beard) on Io one second after you get this. \n\nI'm still not sure how I'm gonna send my letters to you yet.

They did it, Clovis Bray and Papa and all the BrayTech scientists made real walking, talking, human-shaped AIs! \n\nI even got to see one when Papa was giving us a tour of the colony! It looked so cool and shiny. It even had these awesome glow-lights for eyes! I wanted to talk to it, but Dad said I couldn't be trusted not to ask too many questions, so he went over on his own. Papa told me that's why Dad is here: to talk to the Exos and analyze their \"human-ness.\" \n\nHe also said he thinks I can be trusted, especially when it comes to keeping my excitement to myself. Some people are scared of the Exos. Which I don't get. How can anyone be anything but amazed by them? \n\nPapa laughed when I asked him that. \"You're like me. Always seeking out the new and interesting. We forget to fear what we don't know.\" \n\nBut he didn't laugh long before he got serious. \"Sometimes that can get us into trouble. That's why we have people like Dad to balance us out.\" \n\nThat's when Dad came back, looking kinda worried. He wouldn't tell us anything because of \"doctor-patient confidentiality.\" Which is annoying. That's what he always says! Except this time it doesn't make sense because they're not real patients.\n\nBefore I could point that out, Papa asked if I wanted to peek inside the factory. Which, of course, I did.

I'm from Mars. But right now, me and my Dad are on our way to join my Papa at a brand-new colony on Europa! Papa is the lead quantum engineer at BrayTech, which basically means he builds super-cool computers. He's so good at it, he gets to work with the Clovis Bray on all the top-secret stuff. He even designed some of Rasputin's hardware! \n\nI hope he shows me what he's working on.

Maybe Papa got him on one of his projects to finally prove him wrong. \n\nWhat do you have: a hard drive or a brain? Are you an AI like Rasputin? Have you ever talked to him?\n\nSorry if these questions are nosy. Dad says I'm super curious and that's okay, I just need to learn when to stop asking questions.

There's only 50 of us kids, so they shoved us all in one room with two teachers, which is how I found out that everyone got a penguin plushie. I feel dumb thinking I was the only one, but also, it's kinda dumb of Clovis Bray to assume babies and big kids would want the same toy.

The sky above was completely black, except for one bright moon in the distance. Just as I was looking up, wondering what to do next… Dad woke me up. \n\nAt first I was mad, but he reminded me that dreams are messages from deep inside our minds.

But of course, when we got outside, everyone went running in a bunch of directions. That's when I decided I'd learn more useful stuff over at the Exo factory with Papa and Dad. I didn't break the rules. The factory was in sight, plus I had two buddies: Mihaylova and Calumet. \n\nI knew I couldn't go in the front door without a badge.

You have revealed your weaknesses and, through Stasis, I have become powerful enough to rid us of your curse on existence. We control the Darkness and the Light now, and it will be your undoing. Your hands are wet with the blood of my allies. I have not forgotten the suffering your meddling has caused. We saw you, the puppet master behind Oryx's plot.

Your orchestration has led to too many foul notes. All your attempts to subjugate this power have failed.\n\nYou are a plague, and we are the cure. Your army will be eradicated, and the Hive will be a layer of dust, cushioning our footsteps. Trust me—you will hate it. \n\nI find myself giddy at these thoughts. Revenge suits me, it seems.

You have stood by me, and we have been empowered, enlightened, and vivified. We have struck a balance.\n\nThere is much that you are already aware of. You have seen how the Darkness does not seek to subjugate, as the Light does not. They are tools. They are choices. They are made to be commanded and controlled. This is clear now.\n\nAlong the path, you have been the only consistent allies worth trusting. I have my doubts about the Stranger and, similarly, the Drifter. If they fail us, or worse—attempt to deceive us—we will have to continue on without their support. I do not fear that possibility. As long as we are together, we will be unstoppable. We can recover what has been stolen from us and procure retribution for that which is irreparable.\n\nWe finally have control over the Darkness and can use it against those who seek to destroy us. All of us now have the means to persevere and win this war. Any Cabal insurrection will be thwarted before it's allowed to endanger. The Vex will be banished to some forgotten time. The Fallen will surrender, or perish. And what of Savathûn and her forces? They will bend until they break into decomposing pieces of refuse. Stasis provides an answer to where we have fallen short previously. Use this power, with me, to abolish our foes and prevent what our forbearers could not.

You have always remained an ally, without my asking. \n\nI am now asking. The Darkness's arrival ushers in a new age and, with it, the revelation of Stasis. We must seize this opportunity before it is too late. This Collapse now escalates—our enemies' agendas advance, and we are losing. \n\nThe Vanguard has played its part in bringing us to this stage, but Zavala is stalwart and far too stringent in his ways. He will never permit us to wield the Darkness in service of the Light. I know this journey into Darkness is dangerous and unprecedented. You and I know few have tried, and even fewer have lived. We will become the exception. \n\nIt is an audacious claim, surely uttered by easily corrupted fools, but it is one I intend to see through. I know what they are saying. They fear what I will become. Help me to assuage those fears. I am in control.\n\nI have touched Darkness and have seen its plans for us. Do not trust it or its messages of peace and salvation. Stasis is not a gift; it is a tool. One that can be molded to fit our needs, and I have seen how to manipulate it for our gain.

His point of view is unique, but it may be more valuable than I had anticipated.\"\n\nOsiris opened his hand and cast a small projection: a fleet of Pyramid ships.\n\n\"Since the Traveler's reformation, Brother Vance has been studying prophecies where such an event took place. He believes he has discovered a way to stop the Pyramids.\"\n\nA spiderweb of trajectories crisscrossed the projection. There was a flash and the Pyramid ships melted into Osiris's palm.\n\nZavala leaned forward. \"He found this by studying simulated realities?\"\n\n\"Specifically realities where the Pyramids invade our system and the Traveler reforms,\" Osiris said. \"In all the realities where the City survives, Brother Vance believes there is a common thread.\"\n\n\"I… know Vance,\" Zavala said carefully. \"Can we put our future in his hands?\"\n\nOsiris bristled reflexively, but then made a reconciliatory gesture. \"We have seen more than our share of tomorrows, wouldn't you agree? We have done so through the strength of our community.\" The Warlock laced his fingers together.\n\n\"Brother Vance, he is one man, true. But so were you. So was I.

It's desecrated.\" Siegfried swiped the samples into his satchel from the gear rack in his tent.  \"In truth, I'd prefer you remained stowed until we departed.\"\n\n\"You were not so rude as a boy, you know.\" The Ghost squinted at his Titan. \"When I express concern Master Siegfried tells me not to fret. Could I not say the same?\"\n\n\"Different times, old friend. Now my body's a fair bit cheaper to replace than yours.\" Siegfried joked.\n\n\"Fine point, Sir.\"\n\nThe journey to the Techeuns was silent and uncomfortable. He met Petra in the cabin nose-deep in papers. Hoarse screams buried in the hard-blown fog. The Reef was shifting. She had requested his presence but informed him he would not be allowed inside the Temple. Ridiculous. Why was he here? Siegfried's thoughts were abuzz with distortion. Chaos. He followed Petra's march to the Temple chambers, the satchel of samples gripped tightly in his hand. She must have her reasons.  Her secrets. The stairways seemed endless and Siegfried could not shake the image from the cavern. That macabre ritual. He tried to think of anything else.\n\n\"Are there any other Guardians operating in this area?\" Siegfried questioned.\n\n\"Guardians come and go, but I haven't noticed anything unusual, if that's what you mean.\"\n\n\"Nothing you aren't telling me?\"\n\n\"I have no reason to lie to you, Titan.\"\n\n\"I saw a man.\"\n\nPetra stopped walking. The Temple door was only a few steps away. \"Is there more?\"\n\n\"He was Awoken.

Entrapment. The helplessness. Pulling strings in their small, little corners. Let them be, watched but undisturbed, and they catch other pests. Worse pests.\" Petra strode forward and placed a hand on the door. \"Maybe it's time to check his web.\" The other held out for the satchel. \"I'll look into it.\"\n\nSiegfried placed it in her hand. \"I eagerly await your findings.\"\n\n\"The Techeuns may need your account.\" Petra smirked to herself, \"I give you dominion over these stairs. Stand guard, Sir Titan. Patrol if you'd like.\"\n\nKalli, Sendia, and Shuro Chi awaited the Queen's Wrath. They placed the specimens each in a sealed containment vessel. They assessed them one by one. They prepared their minds. Slipped into meditation.\n\nTooth, blood, and bone from the sacrificial Knight. Coagulated Soulfire.

Avatar of War.\n\nMore. So much more.\n\nThey witnessed it all.\n\nPetra wished she had not.\n\nSiegfried sat lost in thought, seated on the steps. He didn't like the idea of relying on witchcraft, especially that which he was unable to observe. If nothing else, it could at least be faster.\n\nThe door opened behind him. Petra's face showed signs of fatigue. \"I'm sorry to keep you waiting. Return to the staging ground. I'll join you in the morning. There is still much to discuss here.\" She considered Siegfried for a moment. \"Tell the Vanguard Ikora's dream had merit. I'll be in contact.\"\n\nSiegfried sighed and stood. \"I see my account of the situation was not necessary.\"\n\nHe felt lighter now, moving down the stairs. Sharp even, as he entered the skimmer. Siegfried wasn't sure if it was the peace of an empty cabin or the security of a troop carrier escorting him. The satchel he had left with Petra. None of his concern. He removed his helmet and took a deep breath. He let his mind drift as he watched the beauty of the Strand pass. The grand gateway above him. The fabled crystalline wall standing against the fog. The wall. Atop the wall. Perched like a buzzard.\n\nIt was him.\n\nSomething hovered with him, glinting in the light.\n\n\"There he is again!\" barked Siegfried. He flung the door open and leapt without waiting for the skimmer to slow. The Titan soared through the air on Light, surging forward in an electrified dash before sliding into a full sprint. He crested the hill above the crystalline wall soon enough. Motion dragged into the shoreline mist. Siegfried pursued it.","icon":null}},"1751192586":{"hash":1751192586,"index":1531,"redacted":false,"name":null,"iconImagePath":null,"colorImagePath":null,"displayProperties":{"name":"","description":"","icon":null}},"1766367980":{"hash":1766367980,"index":1529,"redacted":false,"name":null,"iconImagePath":null,"colorImagePath":null,"displayProperties":{"name":"Phobos Warden Helm","description":"I\n\nZavala stared at the blank pages on his desk.\n\nHe sat with his back to the window.

The clawing repetition to breach unspoiled air taught that persistence rewards. Over time with the Light, panicked bloody defeats instead became swift victories and acclaim. Clumsy and unrefined, it was enough to win battles with flashy results.\n\nGlitz drew attention to the verboten fighting ring. Its coordinators had not informed the Spider of the Syndicate's contributions to its stores of Ether, nor their discovery of another unclaimed Lightbearer. Instead, they had chosen to pocket cuts and remain silent. They sought to quiet the rumors and retain the flow. In their haste to dispatch her and trap her Ghost, they taught Trihn to devour and the Void freed her mind.

The ring still required dismantling.\n\nTwo days ago, she pressed beyond the Tangled Shore and its watchful baron, into the no man's land between Awoken borders and lawless drifting slag-rock. Trihn hunted vengeance, and Ether: her first nourishment; invigorating habitual nostalgia.

We can catch them before it gets dark.\"\n\n\"They'll hear us coming if we get too close.\"\n\n\"And?\" Trihn whipped back mustard-colored robes to straighten two short Eliksni-style scabbards at her hips before mounting her Pike. A thundercrack sent her into the astral wind.\n\nShakto compiled into existence in a holstered seat in the chassis, set just above the Pike's maneuvering apparatus.

The existence of Exos who reset themselves—for whatever reason—proved that.\n\nOr did they?\n\nA quick search of the medical archives turned up ailments and causes considered quackery by the Golden Age: psychogenic amnesia, dissociative fugue, retrograde memory loss, personal obliteration, betrayal theory…\n\nWhat did it all mean?\n\nLakshmi-2 felt uncertain, and that always boded ill.","icon":null}},"1953865369":{"hash":1953865369,"index":1512,"redacted":false,"name":null,"iconImagePath":null,"colorImagePath":null,"displayProperties":{"name":"Calamity Rig Plate","description":"How do you feel about all this, hero?\n\nYou've got a dead heart beating in your chest right now.

I was led to believe that top minds would be assembled in a collective effort to cure [REDACTED]. That was a lie. I am requesting safe passage to Earth and to be removed from the [REDACTED]. [REDACTED] has demonstrated he is incapable of empathy and will travel to the furthest reaches of our solar system to avoid legal ramifications to pursue his twisted vision. I quickly discovered his endeavor was less of a colony and more of a cult: you are either with him or against him. I was once his closest confidant. Now I hardly recognize him.\n\nHis experiments have become deranged and torturous, all while he maintains the calm lucidity of a sociopath. It is my opinion that his research and assets be frozen, so he can be retrieved and dealt a swift, unflinching justice. He is compromised and is being manipulated. To describe what I've witnessed would be a gratuitous exercise in horror, but I fear without clear circumstantial accounts, there will be no action.\n\nOne case recklessly and viciously cost a young man, [REDACTED] , the loss of his motor skills and, eventually, his life. The notion of downloading a human consciousness for preservation is not new, but an effective and nonlethal means of doing so has yet to be presented. After months of trials with brain scans that proved they were not comprehensive enough to provide more than a memory bank, [REDACTED] obsession grew. He wanted the bank to achieve [REDACTED] and [REDACTED]. He was seeking the [REDACTED]. It rapidly became clear that his intentions were dubious. [REDACTED] brain was scanned beyond legal standards, and his exposure to radiation incited the accelerated growth of a tumor that impaired his cognitive function. He was moribund and should have been released from this experiment.\n\n[REDACTED] insisted this was a small hurdle, and [REDACTED] had been our most lucrative candidate, so all efforts went toward the removal of his tumor. That was when I was made aware of the milky [REDACTED] substance. He was farming the [REDACTED] that passed through the [REDACTED] he constructed under mysterious guidance for their [REDACTED]. I suspect he intends to [REDACTED], so he can close the [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] his converts to [REDACTED] directly from them. Here is the proof:\n\nWe started with injections in moderate doses under heavy surveillance. Remarkably, the tumor began to recede, and some functions were restored. He was prescribed more injections. Suddenly, he was being force-fed liters in hopes of reversing all the damage he suffered. At first we believed we stumbled onto a cure-all miracle, but soon the ramifications of our unnatural meddling reared their ugly heads. His body chemistry changed—he was overrun with new elements foreign to our periodic table. He was becoming a [REDACTED]; the [REDACTED] was [REDACTED]. The mutilation he endured as [REDACTED] replaced [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] replaced [REDACTED] was beyond the ethical code of conduct and against the moral fibers that bind us. He grew strong, violent, and incomprehensible. He was a threat to us all and was terminated after an attack where two colleagues fell victim to an outburst.\n\nThis is one case of hundreds. Past dictators have committed [REDACTED] that pale in comparison, and this was never anything more than a quest for his own ego and [REDACTED].  I fear this is only the beginning.

The entranced Servitor had dimmed, and foul-smelling liquid spilled from punctures and rutted gashes in its plating. Trihn looked the machine over curiously. It was an oddity this far from the Shore, and to be left unprotected was even stranger.\n\nToppled in the dirt, an Arc spear tip drew her eye to an open case of digging tools, high-tensile strength line, and respirator filters— and just beyond: the wheezing Captain. Trihn scooped the spear from the ground and walked the few short steps to him.\n\n\"What name do you go by, cur of Driksys?\" Her Eliksni was of the Shore, a crudeform result of the elegant language diluted by Sol-domestic phrases and pronunciations.\n\nThe Captain thrashed and rolled onto its back, snapping quills like kindling. It propped itself on rough-hewn fleshy stubs to extend its reach and swiped at her with its single remaining arm. Froth spilled from its cracked mask, and underneath a broken section at the brow-line, a maddened eye fixated on her.\n\n\"What's wrong with him?\"\n\n Shakto materialized at Trihn's side. \"I don't know.

She cracked off one of the lids with the spear and set both aside. Just short of a dozen full fragile vials containing delicate blue jostled within soft packaging. Save a few with froth percolating through worn seals, the Ether swished like plasma-fluid surf inside the glass. \"They wouldn't leave this much unattended.\"\n\nShakto followed the dirt-dragged trail back from the Captain to a curve in the stony walls of the gulley. The trail led him to a narrow separation in the rock face. \"Trihn.\"\n\nIt was enough space to contort her body through. Scrapes ran from the edges of the split into a slithering dark tunnel. Trihn took a stone from the ground and rolled it in her hands, coaxing condensed smoothness from it with palms of Void-Light. She flicked the glowing sphere into the separation and watched it roll a few meters along a line before it skipped over the edge and fell steeply out of sight.\n\n\"You think it fell straight through the Reef?\"\n\n\"I'd say no. That rope goes somewhere.\"\n\nTrihn squeezed shallow breaths into her lungs with each shuffling step. It was all the stone pressing on her ribs would allow. She closed her eyes to keep instinctual panic in check and lurched forward with a final step to meet the precipice. The walls opened; her lungs filled. Line dangled beneath her feet. She grabbed the line and tested the solidity of the ground-spike holding it in place.\n\n\"Shakto, I'm going down.\"\n\nSeveral meters deep in the darkness, buzzing spelunking lights set a grizzly scene aglow. Three Vandals, two Dregs, and a Captain lay slain and lifeless and ripped agape—some residually twitching from Arc blade cuts. Near the Captain, two severed arms bled pools.

Plucked from the Speaker's library, it's become delicate with age, or so he assumes, taking extra care turning each page. His sense of touch is good; there's certainly enough circuitry in his metal fingers to pull off the most precise of shots. But even a hair-trigger touch might rip the brittle paper… \n\nCayde pauses on a page. \"If sailor tales and sailor tunes, storm and adventure, heat and cold—\"\n\nSuddenly, a gust of surprisingly icy wind nearly rips the book from Cayde's hands. \"To hell with this godforsaken ice cube!\" he shouts, almost falling from his perch. \n\nHe steadies himself and inhales deeply. Hang on there, Cayde. You're not on any ice cube, godforsaken or otherwise.

The snow-white plains of a distant moon, a sarcophagus of ice and iron.\n\n—flash—\n\nYes, that's what Europa feels like to Cayde-1 as he loads crate after crate onto the bay outside the Exoscience factory. Even the sky has turned a flat gray, casting all beneath it in dull, deadening light. A warning sky, he thinks. Sailors had some kinda rhyme for it, didn't they?\n\nEither way, it hardly makes for a motivating work environment. Cayde sits on one of the crates. \"I'm taking a break,\" he announces. \"Need to or not, this is when we used to have lunch. I refuse to work through lunch.\"\n\nNext to him, Knox-4 sighs with relief and longing. \"I miss lunch. I miss getting hungry.\"\n\nCayde grins as much as his mechanical face will allow. \"Hmm…\" he intones in his best Dr. Abrams impression, \"So you would say… you're hungry for hunger?\"\n\nKnox bursts into guffaws. Cayde chuckles weakly. It wasn't that funny. But as his friend's laughter grows, so does Cayde's. Soon, they're both clutching each other and howling. \n\nThen, gradually, their cheer fades. \"What do you tell that shrink, by the way?\" Knox asks. \"You tell him about the whisper?\"\n\nCayde shakes his head. Before he can snark about the uselessness of psychologists, the whisper rings in his metal skull. It's red sky in morning, sailor's warning.

Did we really—whoa!\" Piri cried and dove away as a beam of energy vaporized the tangle of vines through which she flew. \n\nLisbon realized Divinity was too slow. He switched to his Hand Cannon.\n\nShards of stone from a nearby explosion suddenly battered Piri's shell. She had hoped she could talk her way out of this. But there was no time to think—just run.\n\n\"Listen, Lisbon! Please!\" Piri pleaded. Each word was punctuated by a roar from his gun. She dodged the resulting explosions along the terrain. \"Honestly, if you want to shoot me, I'll let you! Just stop and tell me why first!\"\n\nA grenade whirled through the air in response. Piri had seen this tactic too many times to be fooled. She zipped toward the falling explosive and sheltered under a shelf of rock. The blast rattled her senses, but Piri didn't have time for them to clear. She sped through the smoking terrain, inches above the ground, knowing Lisbon would be looking for her flight to either side of the drifting cloud.\n\nAnd then in an instant, the feet of Lisbon-13 materialized in the smoke before her.

This is not the way.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\nLisbon-13 was not looking at his Ghost. \"It's not that the power is too terrible to wield. It's that the burden is too great to bear.\"\n\n\"Burden?\" Piri asked. The Ghost dodged as Lisbon-13 suddenly stepped forward and brushed past her.\n\nAnd stood, facing himself, once again.\n\nThe doppelganger—this other Lisbon-13—reached out and put a hand on the shoulder of the Lisbon-13 that stood a few paces behind Piri.\n\n\"You never doubted yourself. Not for a moment. The others revealed their weaknesses: their pride and self-absorption. But you remember what Rekkana said,\" it stated.\n\nLisbon-13 nodded. \"If anyone can handle the responsibility of this power—\"\n\n\"It's you,\" the doppelganger finished. \"What you fear now is not the responsibility you have assumed. It is the burden…\" the doppelganger said, glancing back at the Ghost, \"…of having all this power and never getting what you want.\"\n\nLisbon-13 had seemed distant and cold to his fireteam and his Ghost. The arguments since the Black Garden, the fighting—oh, how she had pleaded to stop the fighting! All nails in the coffin of something dead within Lisbon-13—something killed by this doppelganger in the garden's grotto. But now, some of the old Lisbon's warmth blazed white hot as he shook off his double's hand. \"You did this! You ruined everything,\" he said.\n\n\"We are all responsible for our choices.

They had encircled him like a tenderfoot calf. He had underestimated the Wrathborn's resilience. Made a fool of himself to show up a couple Fallen on a dead rock—but a breakage heals stronger if it's set right.\n\nThey closed the distance quickly. The Wrathborn's lair was a small cave hovel with a bend just passed the entrance. He could almost see the creature's breath through the stone, feel its movements.\n\n\"Does the Guardian wish for Web Mines?\" Vynriis held a mine out to Gaelin sheepishly.\n\nGaelin took it. \"Let's line the entrance, Vynriis.\"\n\n\"How many?\"\n\n\"All of them.

Guess I'll be bait.\"\n\nGaelin-4 entered the cave and saw the Wrathborn caressing a tendril rooted in its back. Before it, a shrine of black twisted spines. They had begun to harden and gain a translucent metallic sheen, increasingly stained by drippings as his eye wandered higher. The missing associates hung impaled at their apex as tarnished crowns. The spines fed upon them, and Gaelin could see the planted stems weaving together at the base. The Wrathborn yanked the tendril from its back and planted it. They quivered. A hint of a voice. Gaelin would look upon them no longer.\n\nHe formed a vortex of Void in his palm and slung it beneath the Wrathborn. It stumbled backward as the grenade burned away. Behind it, the Fallen bodies disintegrated, but the spires remained unscathed and thirsty. The Wrathborn turned to pursue him, ripping at the ground, ceiling, and walls for holds.\n\nThe Guardian ran and dove over a line of Web Mines at the cave mouth. He cloaked as the Wrathborn was barraged by their spheres of Arc disruption.\n\nNivviks and Vynriis pelted the beast with Wire Rifle shots, fending off tendrils and drawing attention from Gaelin-4. The Guardian nocked a Void-Light bolt and cast his Shadowshot into the Wrathborn's chest, drawing its limbs in with crushing gravity. The trio drew Arc-cage stake-points and flung them into position around the incapacitated Wrathborn. As the last stake made connection, the Arc-cage sprung and shocked the beast into unconscious submission.\n\nMorning light trickled over the horizon as the three finished tying down the cage for transfer.\n\n\"Better this time,\" Nivviks croaked. \"Cave is unsettling.\"\n\n\"Web Mines were a good idea,\" the Guardian replied. He sighed. \"I strongly advise you demo that cave.\"\n\n\"Agreed.

They didn't seem to notice the signal. At the signal's source, I discovered a small camp of what I initially thought were Scorn. Upon further observation, I found that these were not Scorn but Fallen afflicted with some kind of flesh deformity and mental degradation. Shot one dead and the others just looked at me. They didn't fight back. Fired a few cesium charges into the asteroid hole and watched 'em burn. Just sat there. I didn't hear it clearly, but they were chanting something. I don't know.

The weapon was not loaded, and I put them down. \n\nRc-9: My logs will show a few recovered pieces of equipment that I will list now. One presumably organic section of the Hive structure. It is perpetually wet, just… great job on that, and causes dizziness and blurred vision when held with ungloved hands. It also has the unnerving ability to project dysphoria or general unease.

Huddle up so I don't have to shout.\n\n\"A long time ago, the raiders came every winter. They came and took nearly all our stored food, and many in our village starved. But then spring would come with time for planting, and another summer. In the autumn, we harvested as we are doing now. Each time, we stored even more food, and we hid it more carefully, in case the raiders returned.\n\n\"And they did. When they saw that we had survived the winter, they fought even harder for our food, and found nearly all that we had hidden. And so it was, for too many years. They always took from us, never giving anything in return.\n\n\"And then, one autumn night, there was a great rumbling. At first some thought it was thunder, but it was the roar of the raiders' quads in the valleys. They had come early!\n\n\"Maybe they had a new leader. Perhaps they were too impatient for the harvest. We'll never know.\n \n\"Because as the raiders roared through our village, a blue-white bolt of lightning struck among them—BOOM! Before anyone's eyes had cleared of spots, a masked stranger clad in robes and wielding a crook had killed a score of them. With her weapon, she hooked lightning from the clouds and hurled it, thundering among them.\n\n\"They say there was something more than mortal about her, for those who were there said she could move faster than the eye could track, and her steps took her higher than anyone could leap. But eventually, the raiders surrounded her, and she fell to their guns.\n\n\"Yet there was something else different about her: the storm crow. It flew at her shoulder, and when she fell, it looked upon her body, and under its gaze, she rose again.\n\n\"This time, she pointed her crook to the sky, and clouds moved at her command. Our people fled as thunderbolts stampeded through the village. Our homes were not safe. Only our root cellars, like this bunker, were a refuge.\n\n\"No one emerged until the thunder ceased rolling. The raiders had fallen or fled. None would return, not until three winters had passed. And now, raiders only trouble us outside the village.\n\n\"So when you see the purple mist rise from the hills and hear the thunder, that is your sign to take shelter.

Six Corsairs sporting Tigerspite Rifles made final checks on their gear. Movement became still salutes as Petra and Siegfried approached the staging ground. Just ahead, nestled in the Divalian Mists, menaced a fetid pit trimmed in Hive bio-growth. Frenetic inhuman whispers echoed from within like hoarse cords screaming.\n\nField holos displayed maps of twisting tunnelways all orbiting one central chasm. Within the nest, a point flagged their objective. Approach markers tracked the most direct path through.\n\n\"At ease, Corsairs. This is Siegfried. He is here to assist you in flushing the Hive from this nest and reclaiming our land. Inside, he is in command. My guard and I will hold this forward station. You all know what to do. For the Queen.\" Petra pivoted to allow Siegfried the floor. \"Titan.\"\n\n\"Well met, Awoken of the Reef. The Vanguard stands with you. I am the spearhead. Advance on me and we will prevail.\" Siegfried donned his helmet. \"I will not fail you.\"\n\nThe fireteam embarked, and in the subterranean ever-dark, the Hive descended upon them. Droves of Thrall choked the tunnels as gunfire deluge hammered from behind rallying barricades without pause. Siegfried lit the hollow with brilliant Arc fulmination, and rounds found targets. Claws drew blood and rent armor, but neither Titan nor Corsair wavered. Seven entered and seven stood. With each break in the flood, they took ground under cover of storm.\n\nSiegfried arced through the filth like a deadly spark. Each charge scattered the opposition, leaving only crackling chitin, expended shells, and galvanized ozone.\n\nSoulfire fumes fouled the air as reinforcements phased into ritual circles. Acolytes loped to flank the Titan only to be cut off by Corsair suppressing fire. Siegfried faced down a towering Knight with a man-hewing blade. He formed two flashbangs in his fists and lunged with a blinding combo. The Knight shrieked, narrowly missing Siegfried's head with its cleaver. The Titan launched forward, and the fiend fell to the rolling tempest. Labored breathing was the only sound that remained. The Titan looked to a blocked tunnelway in the floor before them.\n\nSlick Hive excretion lined the chasm ahead. \"This must be their sanctum.\" Siegfried's palm pulsed with Light. The faint silhouette of a Ghost popped in and out of existence. \"Yes. This is it. Fall back and form a perimeter. If I don't return, you are to retreat.\"\n\n Siegfried ripped through the mucus-seal and slid into the dim cavern. Foul fluid trickled from the ceiling in drips and spattered in pools at his feet. A monument of gore writhed before him. Soft tendrils convulsed around a jaundiced grim glow. They grew from the twisted base of an eviscerated Knight—its back and ribs pulled through its split abdomen, bending inside-out in half-completed metamorphosis.\n\n\"You vile thing.\" Siegfried walked slowly, his sight focused on the grotesque shrine. The Knight's eyes followed his every step. He was mere meters from the horror when the earth burst on either side of him. Two Ogres stumbled from chitin-covered sacs he had mistaken for walls. He drew his Invective and with well-placed blasts, dispatched the first. Siegfried turned to the second, but it was already upon him. It batted him into a cavern wall and wailed as energy beamed from its eye.\n\nSiegfried raised a towering barricade just as the Ogre unleashed its hellish gaze. Cracks webbed through the Light wall. Siegfried braced it with both hands. The Ogre shook the ground as it bore down on him. The Titan readied himself to clash, lightning welling in his bones.\n\n Movement in the distance. [CRACK] The Ogre's head snapped sideways from a forceful hit. Siegfried followed the sound to a figure perched in the mouth of a tunnel opposite of him. The Ogre turned and roared— [CRACK] Its head blew back, oozing from a raw wound. Three more shots followed from the figure, bringing the Ogre to its knees. The man looked at Siegfried and performed a small bow. The Titan dispersed his shield and seized the Ogre by the neck. He slammed the wounded thing to the ground and brought both fists down with a bolt of electricity and a killing blow. The Titan turned to confront his rescuer but saw only an empty tunnel.\n\nIt was early morning before Siegfried surfaced again. Petra stood stone-still in the camp.\n\n\"I retrieved your samples. You should know that anything I removed regenerated…\" Siegfried lowered his voice. \"…I believe this was a germinal site. Either lady luck is with us, or this was an ambitious expansion off a larger site.\"\n\n\"We're never lucky,\" Petra replied grimly. \"I'll begin narrowing down options for our next strike.\"\n\n\"That line of thinking will be reflected in my report to the Vanguard.\"\n\n\"You've done more than enough for today, Sir Titan.

The structure's form was slender, shapely, and one she had not seen before. It bent in lines that were lost within each other's paths; interconnected without sacrificing distinction. It drew her in. Trihn stepped forward and ungloved her hand. She pressed her palm to the onyx-colored metal spires. Something quivered within, and came alive.\n\n\"What are you?\" she would ask, over the concerned interjections of her Ghost. The Answer, it would reply to her, alone. At least, the first time. The day had drawn long into the night and she had left the cavity, paced in the encampment, and returned many times to the onyx spires. She would prod. It would weave the riposte. Power, in many shapes. Purpose. Time. Meaning. Any trait the ambitious could muster, it would ennoble with standing. It would taper the meat. Lean the fat. Deglaze the waste to flavor the cut. A protean horror of trim. It struck awe. Glory incarnate, made tangible within the beholder.\n\nIt showed her the heap that she clawed life from. It showed her the betrayal Driksys coated her opponent's blades with. It showed her tools they meant to rip apart her Ghost with.

It showed her a head set upon a pike.\n\nMore.\n\nMore.\n\nMore.\n\nThat night she dreamed of the pit. If this living metal thing could lead her to Driksys, the way forward was clear. Shakto said it was taller now. A head above its previous size. She had thought that metal does not grow; it is only reshaped or reduced, but upon reflection, had come to accept aggregation was growth. Trihn returned with tools retrieved from her Pike: some gifts, some collected from marks that no longer needed them, all worn from extended use. Dilution fluid ransacked from the parked Pikes would steady the process. Three canisters of Ether swiped from the encampment dangled around her neck in a makeshift sling while the rest were left stowed in her vehicle's saddlebags. Shakto didn't need to warn her of the danger. It had killed her before. Her first victory, her first reward. It would give her the strength. It would focus her mind.

Muscles tensed and bulged against the sheaths of Light she had bound them in to keep from bursting. Her bones creaked under Ether-bolstered thew. She licked away flavor from her lips, exhalent tinged of briny nitrogen, and shivered. As her body stabilized and the tremors climbed, Trihn's head reflexively craned upward and outstretched her neck. Her mind electrified. Her spine bent at the brim of buckling.","icon":null}},"2714022207":{"hash":2714022207,"index":1366,"redacted":false,"name":null,"iconImagePath":null,"colorImagePath":null,"displayProperties":{"name":"Corsair's Wrath","description":"The Corsair reloaded behind her improvised barricade as Shredder rounds sizzled overhead.

At least the Hall of Names was a fitting place for a last stand. \n\nShe was six rounds short of a full clip. She turned to her left to ask Lira for extra ammo, only to discover her teammate slumped over, blue skin already going grey.

Done. H-349 on the other hand is deadly, not destructive. Much like a viper, its bite does not bring about instant death. Instead, its venom cajoles. It co-opts your beating heart into a death clock, ticking down your last moments. Your own pulse kills you. \n\n Death may be slow and agonizing for its victim.

His Ghost materialized. \"Stay back, Ogden!\" the Praxic Striker called out.\n\n\"Now see here!\" Ogden shouted, \"I will not watch two brothers of the Light do battle. Calm yourselves!\"\n\nA second Ghost materialized. \"Glint. Be careful,\" whispered the figure.\n\n\"We're all on the same side here,\" Glint said meekly.\n\nA Corsair stepped through the mist, rifle pointed at the hooded figure. \"Lay down your arms and come peacefully.\"\n\n\"Oh no.\" Glint looked to the hooded man. \"Wait, Cro—mh.\"\n\nHeat flashed from the hooded man's free hand.\n\n\"'Crome,' is it?\" Siegfried inquired. \"Never heard of you.\"\n\n\"Crome\" spun and threw a crude Solar blade, splitting the Corsair's rifle and slashing his hand. Siegfried moved to disarm; he caught Crome's turning jaw with an electrified fist, but missed the gun. Crome floundered back several paces and dove into the mists.\n\n\"What a disrespectful man,\" Ogden shouted. \"That kind of conduct cannot be allowed.\"\n\n\"I'll put a stop to it,\" Siegfried assured him.\n\nSilhouettes stumbled through fog. Ghosts dematerialized. Corsair radios muddled with chatter. Crome skulked until quiet surrounded him, interrupted by a small burst of propulsion in the mist.\n\nSiegfried was far above him, plummeting through the mist like a coiled storm. Crome glanced upward and took off sprinting. The Striker's fists shattered the ground behind him in thunderous havoc. Crome darted away and twisted, landing on his feet with Dire Promise ready. Siegfried bolted directly toward Crome like living lightning. Each fanned shot from the man's cannon was struck down by bolts arcing from the Titan. Siegfried led with a shoulder. Crome dashed around him and brought Solar flame to form in his hand—\n\n\"Too slow!\" Siegfried whipped a crackling elbow into Crome's stomach and blocked the counterattack. The Titan delivered a knee to the man's ribs that chained into three lightning-fast strikes across the Hunter's body—ending in a thundercrack blow to the temple.\n\nCrome grunted and struggled to maintain his footing.\n\nSiegfried stood emblazoned in voltaic fury. \"You're outclassed.\"\n\n \"I'm pretty good at taking punishment,\" Crome jabbed through clenched, bloodied teeth.\n\n\"Surrender. I won't ask again.\"\n\n\"I can't do that. I'm here to hel—\"\n\nSiegfried charged without hesitation, but Crome was ready this time. Instead of retreating, he leapt forward with a searing blade. Siegfried caught his wrist millimeters before the blade made contact but lost his footing. They grappled in the dirt. Siegfried pried the knife from Crome's hand.\n\n\"Enjoy that,\" Crome said, skidding away from the Titan with a kick to the midsection. The blade turned molten and engulfed Siegfried in a fiery explosion.\n\nThe Striker rose from the blast-cloud, coughing. \"Damned knives…\" Crome was quickly disappearing into the mist.\n\n\"Enough running!\" His voice erupted as he slammed electrified fists into the ground. The shockwave rippled through the dirt and tripped the running Hunter. Siegfried took a step forward. The Hunter rolled to face him, gun red-hot. A beam of Solar destruction sizzled through the mist, clipping Siegfried's pauldron before he could react and knocking him to the floor.\n\nSiegfried could hear the Corsairs nearby. Disoriented and livid, the Titan found his feet, but not his foe. The Hunter was gone. No amount of searching with the Corsairs would change that, but Siegfried kept them looking all through the night just the same.","icon":null}},"2946433642":{"hash":2946433642,"index":1490,"redacted":false,"name":null,"iconImagePath":null,"colorImagePath":null,"displayProperties":{"name":"Calamity Rig Boots","description":"Being one of the Light's chosen blessed magic babies means you always come back with what you lost.

Something he could mount on his wall.\n\nCrow had tracked the associate to an unexplored corner of the Tangled Shore, but when he finally crested the ridge, he saw exactly what he had expected.\n\nThe trail ended at a cryptolith, which jutted crudely from the dark basalt. The whispers of Xivu Arath had caught another of Spider's toadies—just like the last one, and the pair before that. But as Spider said, he wasn't interested in \"mights and maybes.\" He demanded proof.\n\nCrow knelt in the shadow of the cryptolith, the Lure already in his hands. There were recent Eliksni tracks in the fine blue sands; a dozen or so individuals. Nothing he couldn't handle.\n\nHe pulled a vial of condensed Ether from his belt and slotted it into the Lure. The concoction bubbled as it mixed with the soulfire inside the reservoir. Moisture beaded on the Lure's thin metal casing.\n\nHe drove the mount into a crack in the ground, adjusted the output, and watched as the thick pheromone mist rolled away from the Lure.\n\nHe waved Glint over and the pair headed to a rocky vantage point. He tinkered with the compression on his modified Shotgun, placed it across his lap, and prepared himself for the worst part: listening to the cryptolith broadcast its malignant sermon.\n\nHe felt the presence of the spire itch on his skin. Crow tried not to stare at the grotesque totem as it twisted and hummed, but he felt profoundly uncomfortable when its pulsing light was out of his sight. It was as if he was being hunted.\n\nCrow adjusted his weapon sights again as his silent vigil continued. He felt the stress beginning to wear on him. Waves of throbbing pressure emanated from the tower. His eyes ached. He concentrated on his breathing.\n\nGlint flew to a nearby boulder to scan an interesting patch of lichen and Crow closed his eyes, trying to quell the nausea building inside his head. Hushed whispers surrounded him. He felt as though something reached out and caressed his chest, just above his heart. The scent of perfume, soft and familiar…\n\n\"Crow,\" Glint said.\n\nCrow's eyes snapped open. \"I see them.\"\n\nA group of Eliksni Wrathborn were approaching the Lure. One among them wore the telltale quills of the House of Spider. Their movements were uncoordinated but had the troubling strength granted by subservience to Xivu Arath.\n\n\"They're already gone,\" Crow said bitterly.\n\nThe Wrathborn came upon the cryptolith. They were distraught, ranting. Their fury was rising. They lifted their voices in harsh clicking speech and tore at the ground around the Lure with their otherworldly power.\n\nOne passed Crow's perch, and he could see it: cloudy eyes, slavering jaws, an aura of wrath shimmering around it like a heated haze. It charged toward the rest and its rhythmic howls of rage joined theirs.\n\n\"They're chanting,\" Glint whispered, his curiosity forcing him to peek at the growing horde. \"The syntax is garbled, but I could translate—\"\n\n\"Don't,\" Crow said. \"Please.\"\n\nHe looked down the sights of his weapon and started his work.","icon":null}},"3487253372":{"hash":3487253372,"index":1361,"redacted":false,"name":null,"iconImagePath":null,"colorImagePath":null,"displayProperties":{"name":"The Lament","description":"FROM THE DESK OF CLOVIS BRAY\n\nDear… me.\n\nFor one who has delved into some of the greatest secrets science has to offer, you would think I'd find speaking with oneself rather monotonous.

Twenty meters, against the horizon. A lumbering hulk of muscle and high-density Cabal plating indolently ascended a stone column in her firing line.

The tremor ran through her bones.\n\nThe trio swapped to close-band comms. \"Beast in sights.\"\n\nGaelin-4 and Nivviks slowly crawled to her side, taking care not to draw attention in the quiet night. The beast was Cabal all right, red-paint-scraped armor of the Legion buckled against an outpouring of muscle and blistering flesh. From its back and stomach, bladed tendril mutations slithered through gaps in the armor. Its hands were fused in an ever-grip around two massive cleavers that ploughed trenches in the soil as it trundled toward the flames.\n\n\"It appears… abnormal for a Wrathborn,\" Vynriis noted.\n\n\"Old. Perhaps one of the first. An escapee of the Crow's?\" Nivviks mused. \"Preventable. Spider will be displeased.\"\n\nThe Wrathborn Gladiator tore into the wrecked transport. Licks of flame seared its exposed meat without notice, and remnant oil set the Gladiator's cleavers alight in patches.\n\n\"I'll handle this. Excuse me.\" Gaelin-4 stood and strode directly toward the Wrathborn. It lurched to face him and loosed a tortured bellow. Gaelin snapped a smoke bomb into his hand with a flicker of Void Light and flung it into the Wrathborn's mouth. After a muted pop, dull purple smoke poured from its head, and the Wrathborn reeled in the fumes; bloodcurdling shrieks cast plumes of smoke like clouds against the starry backdrop.\n\nGaelin knelt and shouldered Transfiguration. He sent four heavy Arc rounds that cracked splits in the Wrathborn's helm. It howled and stampeded towards him; tendrils lance-hooked into the dirt to rip its body forward faster. It tripped the Shadowshot he had set. Void Light tethered the Wrathborn, anchoring it at the core of its existence. The beast whiplashed and lost its footing; face struck floor—shattering its helmet.\n\n The mad thing rose, smoke billowing from its nostrils like a hellion. It wrenched with every fiber of strength, veins bursting to break.\n\n\"Keep pullin' like that and you'll tire yourself out.\" Gaelin-4 sauntered around the Wrathborn, darting stake-points into the ground to form the Arc-cage's cornerstones. He pulled the third from his belt when he felt something snap within him. It broke the Void tether?\n\nFrom the dying smoke launched a tendril. He ducked it and saw the fiery blade just quick enough to roll over it and into invisibility. He flicked another smoke bomb into his hand and struck the beast between the eyes. It flailed and sent tendrils in his direction. Gaelin rolled back and came up, rifle forward. He dropped the first two and began to reposition when the ground erupted beneath him. A tendril pierced his thigh and dangled him in the air as two more drove at his head and chest. He cracked a spike grenade against his knee. The stick sputtered and beamed with Void Light. He severed the oncoming tendrils with the beam, and they gushed soulfire like a fissured dam.\n\nThe torrent incinerated the grenade and half of Gaelin-4's right arm. His rifle fell. Before the thought to reach became action, the Wrathborn slammed the Exo to the floor and pinned his leg. Gaelin's breath tremored. It raised its horrid cleavers. He drew Lonesome from under his cloak and shot the thing in the eye. It cast him across the site and through a stony point protruding from the ground. Shards of broken rock cascaded around the Guardian. Gaelin clutched a puncture in his chest, a barb of stone protruded from it. The throw had shattered his hip.

One that should by all rights be impossible.\n\nBut they show us the truth. That with enough courage and compassion, anything's possible. Together, they're the lament that carries the voices of every soul lost to these mindless machines.\n\nWith Clovis-43's final strike, the blade shatters into pieces. He doesn't care—the deed is done.\n\nAs the final piece of that monstrous Hydra hits the ground, we burst into cheers. The very few of us that remain. Dr. Bray lets me do the honors. After all, I was there when this all started.\n\nThe command runs. The portal shuts off. We did it.\n\n\"And now, we destroy it,\" Clovis-43 says. He wants it gone for good.\n\n\"No,\" Dr. Bray says. What? I thought she would agree.\n\n\"You know what this did. It has to go.\"\n\n\"Clovis. You, me, and every other Exo… we deserve the life we were promised. If this portal falls, and we die, we lose that life. And if we're gone, and the Vex find some other way back, humanity is doomed. So, let's shut it down. Hell, let's swallow the damn key. But the portal stays.\"\n\nClovis-43 sighs. \"I hope I don't live to regret this.\"\n\n \"Same goes,\" she says sincerely.","icon":"/common/destiny2_content/icons/5d16bac88d2e1a1e16ad83baec99692a.png"}},"4028955445":{"hash":4028955445,"index":1422,"redacted":false,"name":null,"iconImagePath":null,"colorImagePath":null,"displayProperties":{"name":"RECOVERED MEMORY; ANJOLI-7","description":"JUNE4/1:05AM\n\nSo the AI doesn't care if we live or die. Okay, then. Let's take matters into our own hands.\n\nIt's hard to stay quiet with all of us packed into Clovis's office. Didn't get here without a fight, though. Even the secret tunnel we snuck through was rampant with Vex. Lost more of us on the way.\n\nThey're everywhere here too, but fortunately, the walls and windows of Clovis's office are reinforced to handle this kind of thing. Spare no expense, he always said. Though it only ever seemed to apply to himself.\n\nClovis-1's been strapped in, running through the Exo Training Protocol. His stats are beyond what we've ever seen. Breaking records. Nearly breaking the programs themselves. Then again, of course he is. Clovis built him that way. The guy wanted to be the best, alive or dead.\n\n\"If I were Vex, I'd be turning tail and running for my life,\" Clovis-1 says, rising from the training module.\n\n\"Let's put you to the test then,\" Dr. Bray says and points to a locked weapons cabinet. Inside are two weapons. One's a glimmering Pulse Rifle, the other a brilliant Sword with a blade like a chain saw. Thing looks like it could cut through titanium. We tried to bypass the cabinet's security while Clovis-1 was training, but no luck.\n\nThe weapons cabinet scans Clovis-1 as he approaches.\n\n\"Welcome back, Clovis,\" it says as it unlocks. He takes the Sword in hand and smiles. \"You should take that one,\" Clovis-1 tells Dr. Bray.\n\n\"Should I, now?\"\n\n\"How else are we gonna look awesome taking the Vex down together?\"\n\nShe nods. Grabs the rifle and slings it over her shoulder. Looks badass. Dr. Bray grabs something else from the cabinet and pockets it. Looked like a memory bank. Why does she need that?\n\n\"How's it feel?\" Dr. Bray asks.\n\n\"Like it was made for me,\" Clovis-1 says, admiring the craftsmanship of the Sword.\n\n\"In fact, it was,\" a voice booms over the PA system. The AI again. Always watching. Always listening.\n\n\"You should know, strong as you are, this is likely suicide. The Vex truly have disrupted the Cloud Memory Collection system, so your memory banks are no longer transmitting data moment to moment. Anyone who dies out there will be rebuilt here from their previous imprint.\"\n\n\"Then we take imprints now and live with it. Some will stay here. To keep bringing the rest of us back,\" Dr. Bray says. She makes a good point.\n\n\"Rapid Memory Degradation aside, the Vex are many, and they are cunning. It won't be long before they catch on and come after you here. If you're to do this… you'd best fight with everything you've got.\"\n\nSomething lights up outside the office and down the hall. \"I've unlocked the armory. Foolish as you may be, I'd be the bigger fool not to support you in trying.\"\n\n\"This doesn't forgive what you've done. People died. People we can't bring back,\" Dr. Bray says. She doesn't back down.\n\n\"I seek no forgiveness. Only a promise.\" \n\nAlways an angle.\n\n\"Do not destroy the portal.\"\n\n\"Who said anything about destroying it?\"\n\nThe AI sighs. \"You.

That belonged to Elisabeth-1.\"\n\nDr. Bray just shakes her head. \"Why?\"\n\n\"Because I wanted you on my side.\"\n\nClovis-1 is mad. \"It's too late for that.\"\n\nDr. Bray puts a hand on his shoulder. Calms him down. \"We won't destroy it, Clovis,\" she says, winking at Clovis-1.\n\n\"Well, then. Stock up, everyone.

You were stripped down to your most basic emotional form, like all Exos. But help me keep your friends from leaving, and I will tell you everything about your life.\"\n\nThere's a pause. Dr. Bray shakes her head at Clovis-1. \"Please,\" she starts, \"we don't need another Clovis.\" I've seen her speak sincerely before, but this is way beyond that.

Killing countless Vex.\n\nIf only she knew the truth. What Clovis did to her. I've been dying to tell her. But I haven't. Because, well, I didn't want to end up like her. But I can barely stand it.

They possessed an artifact in their stores: a Hive fang. Look to the grooves that run along its root. They allow it to break away from the jaw so that another may take its place. The Hive bear resemblance to another predator I found in simulations of ancient Earth. I don't imagine you've ever seen a shark, Zavala, but you would admire their simplicity and single-minded devotion. They are creatures of predatory instinct. Pure, in a way, to know what one is and act on it. They are not unlike our enemy. Not evil, but driven.\n\nYou will receive a case. Within it, you will find said fang; it is of Xivu Arath, Hive aspect of war. In my travels, I found similar artifacts ground and burnt upon a shrine buried deep beneath Luna's crust. The shrine reeks of Hive magic, and it is obviously the site of a ritual. I fear that in reaction to our Dark visitors, the broken ranks, left leaderless after Hashladûn's demise, called out to be recommitted into the fold. It is time to act, Zavala. She means to test our vulnerability.\n\nDo not wait in your office for the Traveler to guide you. The City looks to the Vanguard to lead us to something better than fear.
