Using volatile Ley Lines similar to those that allow Queen Mara to telepathically communicate (to various degrees) with other Awoken, the Scepter allows its wielder to benefit from bursts of paracausal energy sent by the queen herself.\n\nThis type of energy transference was previously thought impossible, even among the Awoken Paladins and the rumored specialist sect known as the Queensguard. To make matters more complicated, Awoken tradition dictates that all Guardians capable of this feat immediately be granted the rank of Paladin (which is preposterous, as only seven can serve at one time). \n\nInterestingly, Queen Mara has seen fit to distribute Scepters to each active Guardian rather than just the Awoken, and bestow Royal Army titles to all. Even, in an honorary capacity, to the Lightless. Awoken Techeuns and Corsairs now fight alongside allied Human, Exo, Eliksni, and Cabal individuals, and all beneath the queen's royal banner. \n\nHad this development been revealed to me a scant few years ago, I wouldn't have believed it… but this old Cryptarch has seen Guardians fighting with bows and glaives, wielding Stasis and Strand, and is not too stodgy to admit that times have changed—quite possibly for the better.\n\n—Master Rahool","icon":null}},"164103153":{"hash":164103153,"index":2300,"redacted":false,"name":null,"iconImagePath":null,"colorImagePath":null,"displayProperties":{"name":"Unyielding Favor Grips","description":"Saint-14 followed the trajectory of the Hawk as it plummeted.

While the crew huddled under his Ward of Dawn, Saint hurled his shield at the field commander's rifle, then charged. \n\nEven battle couldn't silence his thoughts entirely. It was unkind of him, to wish for Osiris to be here beside him, trading blows with the enemy. Osiris was no longer helpless, but neither was he unchanged. If he were here, Saint would have asked that he stay inside the Ward's shield with the others. \n\nBut Osiris had run off to Neptune, where Saint could do nothing for him but wait. \n\nSaint punched through a Phalanx shield, tore it from the Shadow Legionary's grip, and brought it down repeatedly onto the Legionary's head. \n\nWhen Saint was finished, he extended a hand toward the nearest civilian. \n\n\"Come. Geppetto and I will lead you back to the Farm.\" \n\nThe woman was focused on cutting at her scarf with her knife, working with the determined focus of someone performing a ritual. He looked at the faded violet cloth in her hand, and the familiarity of the moment washed over him.  \n\nSaint sank to one knee and waited patiently as she tied the strip of material to his armor. \n\nThings had not changed so much.

Equipment detected several chemical signatures; samples should be plentiful. If readings are accurate, collected resources will help Neomuna greatly.\n\nTouchdown Evaluation: Initial readings detect nominal quantities of phosphates and bountiful networks of framework silicates. Networks are jutting out from nearby caverns and visible to the naked eye. \n\nI cite novice oil painting skills to describe the networks' hues as such: deep blue, green, and yellow. [NOTE: cross-reference hue interpretation with paint tubes]. \n\nI cite minimal creative writing knowledge to describe the landscape: the hues ripple across amalgamate hills that roll as far as the eye can see. \n\nInitial Exploration: Came upon a shipwreck, very old, parts burnt out beyond recognition. Found items in nearby area:\n\n- 1 armored glove: unusable, built for three digits, one of which appears opposable\n\n- 2 armored shin guards: simple design, both cracked\n\n- 1 helmet: visor intact\n\nObservations: The armor is painted. Markings unrecognizable but appear intentional. \n\nHazard[!]: Fauna observed at nearest cavern—large creatures, MANY legs, pincers. Having no experience in zoology, I conclude: probably unfriendly. Discovered the unique pattern on the found helmet matches the coloring of the creatures. n attempted disguise?\n\nSample Collected: framework silicate, 2.2 kilos.\n\nContinued Observation: Creatures are unfriendly. Attempted to collect more samples, unknowingly encroached on territory. \n\nTheory: Helmet was indeed an attempted disguise, perhaps I will utilize it as well.\n\n[End documentation]","icon":null}},"213264394":{"hash":213264394,"index":2281,"redacted":false,"name":null,"iconImagePath":null,"colorImagePath":null,"displayProperties":{"name":"Buzzard","description":"\"This is foolish,\" Mithrax says, empty hands spread.\n\nThe Trostland forest had been quiet until three Eliksni jumped from their hiding places with weapons sparking with Arc energy.

She swatted it back and focused again.\n\nShe thought of the prisoners languishing within the Pyramid outposts, innocents who needed—\n\nA wet pileus flopped onto her boots, thrumming with terrible memories. She kicked it away with a snarl and thought of her allies, those she'd helped and been helped by along her journey—\n\nThe stone shifted beneath her as the Ascendant Plane rearranged itself with a lurch. She looked up as the egregore on the sides of the abyss began to intertwine, sealing her in.\n\nThere was a cold shock of fear… then rage. I will not die here, she thought. Not in this place. I will not be food for this creeping filth. I—\n\nDruis thought of herself.\n\nHer Light flashed upward, cutting through the nothingness, and touched the favor of the Awoken.\n\nSpirals of tiny purple crystals sprouted from the ground beneath her boots. The shifting stone she stood on locked in place, fused into an amethyst mass.\n\nAn egregore pod wavering inches from her face froze, crystal encrusted, like a piece of sugared fruit. It bent heavily, then snapped under its own weight and shattered on the ground.\n\nDruis wreathed her Light around herself. The egregore on the side of the chasm recoiled as if burned, revealing handholds of bare, clean stone.\n\nShe nodded, tightened her sash, and began the arduous climb back to the top.","icon":null}},"2597227950":{"hash":2597227950,"index":2315,"redacted":true,"name":null,"iconImagePath":null,"colorImagePath":null,"displayProperties":{"name":"Classified","description":"Keep it secret.

It was a clear day, and the light filtered through the canopy of pine trees. After a few deafening shots from the Chaperone, the forest had become so quiet that there was nothing left to hear but their own breaths.\n\nBram lowered the shotgun, hoping against hope that he'd hit the stump this time. He hadn't. Nora let out a snorting laugh that broke the silence like another gunshot. Bram handed the gun back to his wife and rolled his right shoulder, wincing.\n\n\"It's, ah… it's got a kick,\" he said finally.\n\n\"All the best things do,\" Nora said, hefting the gun and aiming down its sights. When she looked back to Bram, he was shaking his head.\n\n\"The first time you let me touch it, and you didn't even warn me it has a kick?\"\n\nNora grinned.\n\n\"You never noticed?\"\n\n\"Well, you never flinch,\" he said, winking.\n\n\"Guess I know it too well,\" she said with a smile. \n\nThe air was chill; he pulled his threadbare coat from his shoulders and draped it onto his wife's.\n\nShe handed the Chaperone back to him and slipped her arms into the coat's sleeves. It didn't quite close over her belly. None of their scavenged winter clothes did anymore. \n\n\"You'll get used to it too,\" she offered. Pity as consolation. He raised the gun.\n\n\"Stand sideways. Now hold it against your hip,\" she said. He propped it on his hipbone; she pushed it aside. \"Not like that.\"\n\nBram rolled his eyes, but it was with a smile. He did as she directed. He had always been a good listener.\n\n\"Remember when we first met?\" she said, stepping away.\n\n\"I met this gun first,\" he replied, and fired.\n\n***\n\nIt had been in some dusty ruin on the road. The business end of the Chaperone was the first thing he'd seen. \n\nBram stared into the barrel before looking into the eyes of the woman holding it. When she saw he was no threat, the muzzle dropped.\n\n\"Nora Jericho,\" she said, as if she hadn't been about to shoot him. \"Where'd you come from?\"\n\nHe gestured behind him.\n\n\"What's your name?\"\n\nHe tried to speak, but nothing came out. He was still shocked into silence.\n\n\"You know it ain't safe here, right?\" she asked.\n\n\"'Cause of you?\" he blurted without thinking. Grimacing, he looked wide-eyed at her for one tense moment.\n\nThen she laughed, a short bark that made him flinch, and held out a hand in greeting. \n\n\"Nora,\" she said, starting again.\n\n\"…Bram,\" he answered at last. He shook her hand and gave a high, breathy laugh–a laugh of relief.\n\n***\n\nThis time the shot hit its mark; the stump burst with the impact. Nora watched her husband smile, slow and triumphant.\n\nThen they heard another shot, then another. A sudden burst of Arc energy seared the tree trunk beside them, crackling and burning. Bram stood frozen, but Nora grabbed the gun away from him and held it steady as she surveyed the rows of straight, tall trees.\n\nA movement at the corner of her eye; she whipped around and fired. She hit the edge of a tree, enough to startle the Fallen behind it.\n\nIt turned to run, tripped on a root, and hit the ground. Its shock pistol skittered out of reach. It rolled onto its back, scrambling, as Nora approached with her gun. She heard no other shots, no other movement. It was alone. It was terrified. Two of its arms had been cut away at the elbow. The Fallen looked up from the barrel of her shotgun and locked eyes with her. It didn't even try to reach for its pistol.\n\nNora stood silent, her finger on the trigger, for a long moment. Then she nodded her head. At this permission, the Fallen rose to its feet, then turned and took off into the forest.\n\nNora waited until she could no longer hear its footsteps. Then she stooped, squatted, and picked up the gun the Fallen had dropped. She handed it to her husband.\n\n\"Here,\" she said. \"More your speed.\"\n\nShe held onto her gun tightly. She wondered, briefly, if the Fallen had heard their practice shots and assumed they fired first. If it had attacked out of fear. She couldn't know. \n\nHer husband's arms came around her. She relaxed her grip on the gun.\n\nThat night, she and Bram lay together in a shelter he had made in an old, rusted truck; he'd cleared the cab of spiders and put down blankets for a little comfort. Nora had climbed in, smiled, and declared it \"good enough.\" In her way, that was thanks.\n\n\"Why'd you let it go?\" Bram asked. Nora thought back to the Fallen's terrified eyes.\n\n\"The Chaperone ain't for killin'. It's for protectin'.\"\n\nBram put a hand on her belly. He felt how their baby shifted inside her. Nora didn't flinch.\n\n\"Little star's got a kick,\" Bram said, with that same high, breathy laugh of relief.\n\n\"All the best things do.\"","icon":"/common/destiny2_content/icons/3334bf3a161a31df1fa5b6320925d066.png"}},"2656540438":{"hash":2656540438,"index":2360,"redacted":true,"name":null,"iconImagePath":null,"colorImagePath":null,"displayProperties":{"name":"Classified","description":"Keep it secret.
