In her cocoon she dreamed of being a Captain, not a priest. She fetches and carries and mops up the old stains nobody else wants to touch, making the station livable again. \n\nDay by day, their home fills up with comforting noise: the pleasant creak of cable ties stringing platforms together, the thump-click, thump-click of footwraps and claws on decking, of the arguments between the only two crewmembers who understand Servitor code. \n\nIt's nothing like a good solid warren—but it's safe, and that's good enough. And once they have Ether flowing in, it'll be even better. \n\nYaraskis tries to ignore the station-voice as she tosses a rag into the machine that is almost an incinerator. \n\nFrom behind, a hand yanks at her hood.

He should be a Servitor's priest or a Splicer. Yaraskis wants to be his Captain, assign him to the priesthood.

But their fussy station keeps reminding them, always in the same cadence. \n\nHe kicks his sledge into gear. It's a relief to get away from the research complexes, from everything in them he doesn't understand. \n\nIstván gets to work. Powering down a grid of the solar catchers, cutting out the damaged material, cutting a new piece from the replacement roll. The only sounds are the squeaking of his suit joints and the hiss of his cutter. \n\n Until the station says, the loudest he's ever heard it, \"Charge at 93%. Threat level alpha!\" \n\nIstván jerks up, cutter gouging a hole in his repair material. No detail. Another false alarm from their fussy station. \n\nEven louder, the station says, \"Charge at 93%. Threat level alpha!\" \n\nHe looks around. Nothing. Except—a handful of fiery glints in the dark. \n\nIstván grabs his sledge. It drags him up the hull, his suit scraping across the catchers in a way that'll leave bruises. He doesn't stop until he finds an overhang. \n\nAnd then he watches fragments of meteor coming in hot from far out of orbit, impacting the solar catchers right where he was standing. His roll of repair material is torn apart in an instant. \n\n\"Technicians are asked to return once system charge drops to 40%.\" \n\nHis charge is sitting steady at 86%. \n\nShakily, he says, \"Heading in. Now.\"","icon":null}},"3219219484":{"hash":3219219484,"index":2837,"redacted":false,"name":null,"iconImagePath":null,"colorImagePath":null,"displayProperties":{"name":"Spacewalk Cloak","description":"Time is suspended.  \n\nAll that remains is the appointed task. \n\nThe spinners craft towropes, powerlines, and all-purpose cable, hour after hour without rest. \n\nThe White Captain moves among them with her many limbs.

One limb may be unsteady, but their great shared body is strong. \n\nFaint noises make no sense. Words she doesn't understand. The un-Eliksni babbling of a foreign mind. \n\nThe only mind that matters is the White Captain's. \n\nHands connect circuits and power lines. The diagram is beautiful but difficult to grasp. She searches for the right shape, the right configuration that will let power flow through its appointed channels. \n\nThe work goes on.  \n\nUntil the hands tie off the last cable.  \n\nThe eyes look up. The knees buckle in joy. The heart surges along the bright paths of the diagram. \n\nSomewhere in the joined crowd, a single hand throws a single lever. \n\nThe mind rejoices. \n\nOrange light flares to life in the cold dark. \n\nIt flares in hundreds of souls.

Even the station-voice would be a comfort, almost. \n\nShe hasn't seen Karrho in days. The remaining engineers only talk to each other, and the Servitors groan and bob in the air together in one nervous bundle. \n\nAnd something is stalking the hallways. \n\nIt has eyes like an Eliksni, but they don't flicker like they should. They burn steadily, lit not by Ether but by something else. Even the Marauders tell her about it in whispers, so scared they ignore hierarchy. \n\nYaraskis feels its presence in her spiracles. She decides to head for Karrho's workshop. She can hide there. \n\nThen a Marauder swings into view. His eyes are strange and he doesn't look at Yaraskis. He just says, \"Come here.\" \n\nShe runs. Through the halls, leaping over platforms strung together, scoring her side badly on an unexpected twist of metal. \n\nThe missing crew loom out of corners, calling out as she runs past. She doesn't stop. \n\nTill a voice calls her by name. \n\nIt's Karrho. He's braced himself in a corner of the ceiling near a broken vent grate that Yaraskis knows leads to the station hull. It's too small for anyone bigger than a Drekh. \n\nShe leaps. Hands claw at her ankles as Yaraskis kicks her way up the wall. \n\n\"This way,\" Karrho urges. They scurry through twisting passages, through the vents and under floors that long-ago Humans never meant for anyone to walk in. They run over wreckage, in and out of the gravity generators' pull, towards the Ketch. Maybe they'll be safe there. Maybe they can cast off and run. \n\n\"What's wrong with them?\" Yaraskis asks, panting. Her heart kicks hard in her chest. \n\n\"Nothing.\" \n\nKarrho stops on a dime at the vent's exit.

The older crew are a little snooty about Drekhs, and that's fine—but Yaraskis can't even find one of them to be snooty at her. \n\nPaskir is still missing.

She doesn't like the big, open ones with their flat, bright lights, reverberating acoustics, and the feeling that something is always watching her. \n\nKarrho stays at his work.
