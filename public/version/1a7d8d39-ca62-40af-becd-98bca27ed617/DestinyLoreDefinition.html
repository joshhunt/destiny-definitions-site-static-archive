She was following an indistinct murmur, both terrifying and compelling. A thousand voices, all muttering to themselves. How did she get here?\n\nShe peered around the corner of a massive archway. Beyond, she found a circular chamber with an elaborate sigil carved into the stone floor. Three Awoken figures stood at precise intervals along the carved seal. \n\nThe chamber was without a ceiling—the void of space yawned overhead. Spiraling galaxies seemed to fill the room. Eido realized that she wasn't breathing. Was she dead? \n\nSuddenly, Eido stood in the center of the sigil. She turned in a circle, trying to identify the looming figures, but their faces were vast and unknowable, like the void above. She felt the weight of their focus, as if she were falling in all directions at once. \n\nShe looked down and discovered with horror that the ground was receding. She was floating upwards, into the vacuum of space. The figures paid her no attention as she drifted away. \n\nAs the chamber fell away beneath her, the murmur condensed and merged until it unified into a single panicked wail. \n\nEido awoke to find the scream coming from her own mouth. Misraaks crouched next to her pallet, wringing his lower hands in concern. \"Be calm, young one. Be calm. You are Eido. You are in the one true now. You are safe.\" \n\nHe gave her a sip of Ether from his own meager reserve and waited patiently until she quieted. \"Tell me of your journey,\" he prompted, intently. \n\nShe explained her experience, as best a hatchling could. \n\nMisraaks nodded gravely. \"The Techeuns. Advisors to our hosts. They are… like Scribes for the Awoken.\" He sat, thinking quietly. \n\n\"I know you are frightened. But I am confident this is a blessing,\" he decided. \"All great things appear first as monsters.\" \n\n\"There may be a day,\" he continued, \"when you are seen as a monster. And your blessing is frightening to those who cannot understand it. When that time comes, remember this moment.\" Eido nodded, though she didn't fully understand. How could a hatchling be a monster? \n\n\"I, too, am sometimes frightened by the Techeuns,\" Misraaks confided. \"But we must look beyond our fear to find the Light. This is courage. Can you show courage?\" \n\nEido nodded again. \n\n\"You can. I'm sure of it,\" Misraaks said proudly. \"The Light provides.\" \n\n\"The Light provides,\" Eido murmured as she lay back down to a peaceful slumber.","icon":null}},"468456840":{"hash":468456840,"index":1766,"redacted":false,"name":null,"iconImagePath":null,"colorImagePath":null,"displayProperties":{"name":"Sunstead Mark (Majestic)","description":"Today I witnessed a Human ritual that I long thought a myth, or at least over-researched relative to its cultural impact. That is, the ingestion of ethanol to induce euphoria and knowingly hinder judgment. \n\nWhen I first learned of this practice in the Techeun's data archives, it seemed preposterous. Why would a predominantly aqueous creature willingly ingest a substance that causes its body to purge liquid? What was the goal? \n\nToday I discovered the answer: \"partying.\" \n\nBased on my observations near community ethanol distribution centers, partying is a distinctly Human form of enjoyment. It is similar to many Eliksni celebrations—a social gathering meant to foster group cohesion—but the Human version involves collective self-poisoning, for which there is no parallel in Eliksni society. \n\nApparently, partying involves a loose constellation of behaviors: speaking much more loudly than normal, making an increased amount of bodily contact, the purging of partially digested food, walking in eccentric patterns, expressions of fondness, increased laughter, public displays of sorrow, and coordinated yelling to previously recorded sounds. \n\nHaving witnessed the prevalence of ethanol consumption in the Last City, I can safely conclude that, if anything, the behavior is under-researched. Humans' fondness for poisoning themselves is prolific—it's a wonder their species has lasted this long. \n\nI admit to curiosity as to the perceived effects of ethanol consumption, because it cannot feel as terrible as it looks. However, I am reluctant to engage in Human partying because I'm not sure an Eliksni could survive it.","icon":null}},"1044615214":{"hash":1044615214,"index":1760,"redacted":false,"name":null,"iconImagePath":null,"colorImagePath":null,"displayProperties":{"name":"Celestine Robes (Majestic)","description":"The Smallest Screeb\n\n Eido loomed over the group of hatchlings, her face lit only by the glow of the Ether tank's control panel. The hatchlings gripped each other's hands in fear and huddled together for safety. The Scribe continued her tale. \n\n\"There once was a Screeb. The smallest Screeb of his clutch. He fought for his share of Dark Ether, but his stronger siblings often got more than he did.\" \n\nThe hatchlings muttered in sympathy. \n\n\"He dreamed of one day killing a Guardian and showing his siblings that he was strong. Little, but strong.\" Eido flexed her lower arms menacingly. \n\n\"One day, a Guardian came to their lair, hoping to steal their precious Dark Ether.\" The hatchlings glanced in worry at the nearby Ether tank as Eido continued. \"Fikrulkel ordered the Screebs to attack. Finally! The smallest Screeb had a chance to prove his worth.\" \n\nEido leaned forward, narrowing her eyes. \"The smallest Screeb charged forward, unafraid, even as his siblings were shot down all around him. He launched himself at the Guardian, and—BOOM!\" the Scribe shouted, clapping both pairs of hands. The hatchlings jumped and chittered in fear. \n\nEido lowered her voice to a whisper. \"The littlest Screeb exploded right against the Guardian's glowing, golden armor. He succeeded in his mission.\" \n\n\"But,\" Eido continued, shaking her head in mock sadness, \"the Guardian didn't even notice. The Screeb was too small and his explosion made no difference.

Blood and Ether seeped across the ice, freezing into rich stains. The Guardian strolled casually from body to body, searching for ammunition and weaponry. \n\nEido had watched the battle through a viewfinder from atop a far-off ridgeline. Even at this distance, the brutality was hard to countenance. She glanced quizzically at Misraaks, who crouched beside her. These were the Guardians her father trusted? \n\nAs if sensing her reservation, Misraaks spoke. \"The Guardians are capable of mercy, though they seldom show it.\" \n\n\"Then why does the Great Machine bless them?\" Eido asked. \"Is it not better to be merciful?\" \n\n\"The Darkness is coming,\" Misraaks replied wearily. \"Nearer now than ever before.

As she scanned their rapt faces, she noticed the unrepaired Shank, languishing on a workbench nearby. That reminded her of a story. \n\n\"There was once an engineer who was the cleverest in her House,\" she told the hatchlings. \"Even more clever than Klyfiks,\" she added. \n\nThe hatchlings chittered in mirth. \n\n\"One day, the engineer's Kell came to her with an order. He told her to build a Shank.\" Eido's tone conveyed the ordinariness of such a demand. \"A simple Shank for patrolling and running diagnostics.\" \n\n\"This was an easy thing for one so clever, but the engineer was offended.\" Eido clenched her fists, miming indignation. \"She demanded to know why she should waste her time on such a simple task.\" \n\nEido deepened her voice in her best imitation of her father: \"'I am leaving for battle soon,' said the Kell. 'And I want the best Shank in the system to guard my dwelling while I'm away!'\"\n\nThe hatchlings shrieked with glee at the Scribe's irreverence. \n\n\"So the engineer set about building the Shank. She was given the finest tools, the finest metals, and even a skilled assistant. Everything she could ever need.\" \n\nEido's tone darkened. \"But inside, she was angry. She resented her duty and wished to work on something more impressive.\" \n\nEido paused, watching the hatchlings for their reactions. It was always fascinating, she thought, to see which eyes held sympathy for the engineer and which did not. \n\n\"In time, she finished her work. The Kell left for battle, and the Shank was set to patrol the Kell's dwelling,\" she continued. \"To everyone's surprise, it bumped into walls, gave incorrect diagnostics, and often turned up in places it shouldn't.\" \n\nThe hatchlings were rapt. \n\n\"The engineer quickly realized what was wrong,\" Eido told them, taking on a low, conspiratorial tone. \"She had given the Shank the wrong spirit. All her anger and pride had poisoned it, like Dark Ether poisons the Scorn.\" \n\nEido watched one hatchling seize the nearest hand of another. She could end the story there, but a glance at the Human sentinels watching their gathering from the lip of the roof above steeled her resolve to continue. \n\n\"One day,\" she continued gravely, \"the poor Shank got so turned around that he mistook the Kell's hatchlings as intruders, and shot them dead.\" \n\nThe hatchlings gasped. Eido imagined she saw one of the Humans' faces soften in sympathy. \n\n\"When the Kell returned, and learned what had happened, he docked all of the engineer's arms and destroyed the Shank.\" Eido's voice was firm. \"The House lost their best engineer, their strongest hatchlings, and their most expensive Shank—all at once.\" \n\n\"Remember,\" she warned, \"we must give our best spirit to all our tasks.

Klyfiks, a young engineer, watched a Human struggle with a large machine. No matter what she did, it continued to billow a thick, oily smoke. Curious, Klyfiks waited until the Human gave up in frustration. \n\nAfter the streets were dark, Klyfiks examined the machine himself. Determined to earn the Humans' trust, Klyfiks stole the machine and took it back to House Light. He worked through the night to repair it, using our scrap as a gesture of good will. \n\nWhen morning came, Klyfiks returned the machine and watched from afar, eager to see the woman's excitement. She turned it on, and watched in astonishment as it rolled smoothly down the road. It still emitted traces of smoke, but at least it moved.  \n\nTo Klyfiks's chagrin, the woman flew into a rage! As I later learned, producing smoke was the machine's whole purpose—something to do with the curing of animal flesh. I myself am still not certain of the details. \n\nAlthough the machine no longer produces smoke in the appropriate manner, it now travels upwards of 20 kilometers per hour on very little fuel. The neighborhood children have been riding it along the street all day. I even saw them gathering supplies to add a steering system. \n\nIn the end, Klyfiks and I agree that it's a great thing he's done.","icon":null}},"1770862261":{"hash":1770862261,"index":1765,"redacted":false,"name":null,"iconImagePath":null,"colorImagePath":null,"displayProperties":{"name":"Sunstead Plate (Majestic)","description":"Today I viewed the Crucible through a feed spliced by one of Misraakskel's apprentices. It was a shocking and horrifying experience. A record of that feed can be found in the addendum of this report.\n\nI had seen the Crucible referenced in the records of the Cryptarchs, who have been most welcoming and eager to exchange data. Historically, the Crucible was a trial by combat, similar to the Cabal Rite of Proving. It was a neutral ground for parties to engage in violence without civilian casualties. However, over centuries it evolved into a blood sport practiced for combat experience, commerce, and enjoyment. \n\nHowever, no amount of study could prepare one for the depravity of the actual event. \n\nHumans immolate each other, melting flesh beneath unpenetrated armor. They drive swords through each other's faces, reveling in the creation of deformity. They unleash bursts of Void and Darkness, consuming each other's bodies with anti-life. The amount of precious ammunition that goes wasted in every match would be punishable by docking in some Eliksni Houses. \n\nAfter the arbitrary conditions for victory have been met, the messengers of the Great Machine emerge. They resurrect the dead, who then sulk off the field as if eternal life were nothing compared to the loss of a sporting match. And then the whole practice begins again. \n\nThe experience has made me wary of our new hosts. They are much more like the Cabal than I had imagined. Humans clearly have the capacity for peace, but they seem to prefer violence. And as long as the Great Machine blesses them, violence will be their way.","icon":null}},"2035035510":{"hash":2035035510,"index":1756,"redacted":false,"name":null,"iconImagePath":null,"colorImagePath":null,"displayProperties":{"name":"Illuminus Cloak (Majestic)","description":"\"And all of the Houses respected their decisions?\" Eido asked, dubious. \n\n\"Yes,\" Variks replied. \"It was so agreed by all of Riis.\" The old Scribe traced his fingers along the datapad, deciphering notes that hadn't been accessed in decades. \n\n\"But didn't all the other Houses fight amongst each other, disputing their decisions?\" Eido leaned forward, fascinated by the idea of one House accruing so much political sway without resorting to violence. \n\n\"To dispute the House of Judgment was to dispute all Eliksni Houses,\" Variks explained. \"It was the voice of the Eliksni, united.\" \n\nEido puzzled over this. The idea of mediation was not new to her—Misraaks often solved problems between House members without violence—but the idea of organizing a whole society using that method was novel. \n\n\"So it was the ruling House,\" Eido concluded. \n\nVariks clicked his mandibles in annoyance. \"No! The House of Judgment was both above and below all other Houses. It was both Kell and Dreg. Its authority came from humility.\" \n\nEido had only ever known of Scribes as political animals. Power-brokers and go-betweens, like Variks. But the idea of Scribes as neutral parties, dedicated to peace and knowledge, was enticing. \n\n\"This is why the old Scribes pursued knowledge relentlessly.

It is about feeling. Feel the energy flow from the ground, through your legs, up your torso, and out through your arm.\" His arms wove circular patterns in the air, as if gently wafting smoke upwards. \"The movement of the Gauntlet is the continuation of a motion that begins deep in the heart of the planet, where it keeps its Light.\" \n\nEido sighed. Misraaks was intent on passing the Way of the Splicer to his daughter, but after three days of attempts without the barest signs of success, they were both becoming frustrated. Eido was eager to learn—to live up to her father's skills—but the harder she tried, the more violently the Gauntlet seemed to reject her. \n\nEido took several deep breaths and extended her mind's eye through the ground, deep into the well of Light at the center of the planet. She followed the Light through the firmament, up through her body, and into the Gauntlet. It whirred smoothly to life. \n\n\"Yes, just so,\" Misraaks encouraged her. \"Now feel the Light extend from the Gauntlet into the Shank. Feel its code lying dormant. It is sleeping, waiting for you to wake it.\" \n\nEido extended the Gauntlet. A surge of energy shot forth from its claws, sending crackles of electricity rippling across the Shank's surface. In her shock, Eido jerked the Gauntlet away, which severed the connection. The electricity sparked for an instant longer, then went still. A small plume of smoke issued forth from deep within the Shank. Eido didn't need to Misraaks to tell her that she had just fried the main circuit net. \n\nMisraaks took a moment to compose himself before speaking. \"This is a good lesson.

A long, appreciative whistle escapes him as he slowly turns and surveys the room.\n\n\"The commander's sure come on up, hasn't he?\" the Hunter remarks, Shotgun still resting on his shoulder. Then, noticing something on a high shelf, he wonders: \"Is that a cat?\"\n\nThe Warlock gives him a gentle shove into the middle of the room, then slowly urges his Shotgun down from his shoulder; her touch leaves an ice-rimmed mark on the barrel. The look she levels at the Hunter is patient, but thinning.\n\n\"I don't recall having a meeting scheduled right now,\" booms a voice from the doorway. Both Warlock and Hunter turn to face Commander Zavala, the Hunter shifting his Shotgun behind his back as his Ghost decompiles the weapon. He gives Zavala a crooked, apologetic smile and shows his hands to the Warlock in a \"Gun? What gun?\" gesture.\n\n\"Commander Zavala,\" the Warlock says with a quick chastising look at her cohort. \"I'm—\"\n\n\"I know who you two are,\" Zavala says as he breezes past them. \"I have a call with the Consensus in ten minutes.

Yet.\"\n\n\"You didn't have a plan before putting them in a bombed-out ditch?\" the Hunter interjects. Zavala's expression is mixed with surprise and aggravation, but he lets out a burst of laughter—it crescendos in an uncharacteristically jovial manner before dissipating into a sigh.\n\n\"I suppose it looks like that,\" Zavala admits. \"This is the territory the Consensus would cede for the time being. But the plan is to turn the area into a community learning annex where the Eliksni and humanity can freely share ideas, culture, and language.\"\n\n\"And they would live there?\" the Warlock asks.\n\n\"No,\" Zavala says with a shake of his head. \"If everything goes well, they'll live in the City. Wherever they'd like. It's just going to take time to build up the piece of Botza District we gave them, and to make sure the people of the City accept them.

No—offense to your city planning strategies, Commander, I just—\"\n\n\"It wasn't my plan,\" Zavala says, motioning to the woman eavesdropping in doorway. \n\n\"Ikora,\" the Warlock says with a respectful incline of her head.\n\n\n\nBoth Warlock and Hunter look shocked at her presence. Ikora smiles demurely and more fully invites herself into the room.\n\n \"When I heard Mithrax's old fireteam had come to the City, I was surprised to see you here, rather than down there with him,\" Ikora says, though she isn't truly surprised. \"Have you given him your regards?\"\n\n\"With everything that happened on Europa, ma'am, we didn't think it prudent. He's still—there's still raw emotions and—with everything going on right now, it's been hard to connect with him,\" the Warlock admits, giving the Hunter a concerned look. Ikora regards them for a moment, then nods and approaches Zavala.\n\n\"Family struggles can be challenging,\" Ikora recognizes, her hand on the back of Zavala's chair. \"Even with found family.

The Warlock and Hunter cast a furtive look to one another, but both are quick to offer silent nods of affirmation. Ikora smiles, having expected that response, and spreads her arms to herd the pair out of Zavala's office.\n\n\"Good. We have a long-range scout operating outside of the City, a newly minted Hunter, and we'd like you two to keep him company,\" Ikora says as she walks.

The pair had been wandering around the massive Hangar for an hour while an enormous ship was being loaded in the background.\n\nJalaal had seen the celestial disappearances and the encroachment of the Black Fleet as clear signs that Dead Orbit's final exodus must soon begin. He had ordered a redoubling of departure preparations, but found the faction's rank-and-file struggling to keep pace. \n\nJalaal cut off his subordinate's bumbling presentation. \"This is insufficient.

They say they can refocus Light \"through the prism of their will.\"\n\nWhile we at the Cryptarchy have nothing but respect for Eliksni culture, we wished to explore the truth behind these claims.\n\nAfter studying one of the few Splicer Gauntlets that fit non-Eliksni hands (graciously created by Mithrax, Kell of the House of Light, for select residents of the Last City), we have determined that the wrist-mounted Gauntlet is little more than a converter that can be used to focus trace amounts of residual Light already present in the environment.\n\nA trained Splicer can use their Gauntlet to interface with any latent data networks in the vicinity. This allows the bearer to access technological mundanities as well as deeper, infinitely more protected networks, including the Vex domain itself.\n\nOnce connected, access to these networks is severely limited for the Eliksni Sacred Splicers, though Guardians, due to their unique relationship with the Light, are able to manifest corporeally within the network for short periods of time. They can then alter the data found therein with focused percussive energy—including gunfire—in a baffling scientific process the Cryptarchy does not yet fully understand.\n\nThe Gauntlet seems capable of powering itself by transmuting unbound energy into Ether. Traditionally, Sacred Splicers would undertake great journeys to charge their Gauntlets with naturally occurring residual energy, but Guardians can use their martial prowess to convert their foes into bountiful energy sources.\n\nIn closing, the Sacred Splicers merely exploit a tool that induces Light to resonate at frequencies approaching that of the Vex Nexus, enabling them to access to certain low-security Vex systems.
