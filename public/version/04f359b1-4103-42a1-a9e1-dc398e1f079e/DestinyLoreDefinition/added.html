In green twilight, it was clear; in golden sunrise, it was aloof. Through day and night, it keeps me company, and from dream to dream, it is there, no matter the sky, no matter indoors or outdoors. In the heart of a deep subterranean compound, the star twinkles in the ventilation ducts. I always know where I am going. \n\n—I dream of a weary wolf with kind eyes, a mother with pups behind her.

Didn't talk much. She kinda liked that. But only kinda. She always felt as if she had to fill the silence. Was she annoying? Did she talk too much? Failsafe reviewed every fireteam feed she had ever recorded, running a thousand queries simultaneously, each one as useless as the last.  \n\nLook at yourself, she said, pushing aside a barrage of query results that put strain on her processor. An AI with anxiety. Only the Golden Age could have produced something as ridiculous as that. \n\n\"A large Vex force is amassing ahead,\" she said helpfully. The fireteam signaled an acknowledgement but said nothing. Another set of notifications and queries began processing, and she turned her attention to them, reviewing and dismissing each one individually.  \n\nThe fireteam should have engaged the Vex by now, she thought. But there was no audio. It had suddenly dropped to silence. \n\nConcerned, she tried to pull up a visual on the fireteam leader's location, but was met with a patchy network connection and the pitch-black interior of some long-forgotten cave. \n\nLosing connection to a feed felt like dropping a bowl of soup. That's the way she described it to Ikora, who had looked at her curiously before changing the subject. Failsafe had seen many bowls of soup dropped when her crew was alive. The cautious, careful adjustment as the soup gets too close to the lip of the bowl. A hissed expletive as a splash of hot soup hits skin. The involuntary jerk as the bowl tips over and crashes to the floor. Then no more soup. Just a spill that needed to be cleaned up. A smear of incomplete data in need of deletion. \n\nThe soup was too close to the lip of the bowl. She adjusted her sensors, widened her parameters. Balanced the data stream. There was nothing. Just nothing.   \n\n\"Fireteam leader,\" she called out. \"Please reestablish uplink to the H.E.L.M.!\" \n\n The visual feed stuttered. Waves of static dissolved into an empty, grey wall of noise. Panic. \n\n\"Fireteam leader,\" Failsafe chirped. \"Please respond!\" \n\nThere was no answer. She let the silence linger for too long. The connection was failing completely. She felt it hiss and spit. A power surge. Then it was over. Just a smear of data and a blank feed. \n\n\"Hello?\" The AI called into the empty feed, her voice small. No answer.

It's my break too.\" If Zidarrh wants to show off his language skills, he needs someone to show off to. \n\nFar below them, the remnants of a radiolarian lake bubble at the center as its levels continue to slowly recede. Zidarrh does not want to think about what might happen when it fully drains. More Vex, probably. \n\nYerg takes a loud drink. \"Planets shouldn't change. It's not right. We crushed up some of this place for the old emperor's wine and there was a Vex monster in it! Bad enough for a planet to have monsters. A planet shouldn't be the monster.\" Yerg hesitates. \"And what if a few Legionaries tried a little wine back then? Just to make sure it was safe for our emperor? Was that monster wine?\" \n\nOn the whole, Zidarrh is relieved she didn't share her juice. He scans the horizon. \n\nThree Guardians on their fancy Pikes drive closer, heading for the draining lake. Yerg nudges Zidarrh hard enough to push him over. \n\nThey wait in silence for the Guardians to enter the cave, one-eyed drones floating at their shoulders. \n\n\"I'm revising my list of things I hate here.

Failsafe directed it to look to its right. A Vex cranium lay on the floor. \n\n\"The Guardian left it,\" Failsafe said, answering the frame's unspoken question. \"Transmatted it in just now.

It was intact, the neck neatly severed, the eye clear and undamaged. \n\n\"Looks good,\" Failsafe said. The frame brought the cranium to the research table and plugged a complex network of wires into ports inside the Vex's head. The eye flashed a stuttering light and Failsafe flashed with it. \n\n\"I can handle it from here,\" Failsafe said. \n\nThe Vex cranium sparked and hissed for one sharp second before Failsafe quelled it with a quickly improvised script.

She relayed a series of command prompts to the incapacitated Vex, the execution of which gave her immediate access to three layers of encrypted data. \n\nIt wasn't enough. She had here a schematic of Nessus's interior, but nothing that her deeper scans hadn't already told her. The Vex's system was reflexively generating junk data as an immune response to her probing. She wrote a subroutine to garbage-collect it as she moved deeper inside the Vex mind. \n\nShe could see some of the deeper tunnels. Their dimensions, the volume of radiolaria. This Vex unit had overseen some of its construction, but that was centuries ago. The planet had shifted. New pathways had been dug, expanded, or rerouted. They went deeper. She struggled to interpret it. Failsafe was becoming crowded with useless data. The Vex unit was trying to overwhelm her. \n\nShe pushed forward. What she found surprised her. This Vex had been disconnected from a Mind for much longer than Failsafe had anticipated. It had collected its own individual data, interpreted it, collated it, and assimilated it on its own. It had completed tasks not at the behest of a Mind, but instead… \n\nAccess denied. \n\nFailsafe pulled back. \n\nThe AI watched in surprise as a self-contained data packet swiftly opened of its own accord and prompted itself to run. Failsafe's hard-coded defense mechanism slammed down, momentarily repelling the intrusive script. \n\n\"Disconnect! Disconnect!\" Failsafe shouted, and the frame rushed to the cranium, pulling out the wires it had connected only moments before. \n\nThere was a long silence but for the gentle whirr of a cooling fan. \n\n\"Huh.

Maya tabs away to study a bar graph.\n\n\"Neuropathy reports show a spike in activity in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus in the moments before brain death,\" Maya reports, eliciting a shaky sigh from Chioma over the comms before she continues her analysis. \"The spikes plateaued for one fifth of a second, which may indicate a receptor error. We may need to utilize an intermediary rather than direct connections. Do the hard wires show any damage?\"\n\nMaya tabs back to the security feed, watching as Chioma wipes her eyes and then assesses one of the dead Exos, checking a thick cable plugged into the back of his head. \"No sign of damage. Capacitance switches didn't trigger. It's…\" She swallows down bile. \"The problem isn't our hardware…\"\n\n'It's theirs,' is a whisper only Maya can hear.\n \n\"It's theirs,\" Maya agrees aloud.\n\n\"I think—I think we need to stop,\" Chioma finds the strength to admit. \"Reassess our findings. Resume analysis of the initial electromagnetic anomaly before contact. We can't keep… we can't…\"\n\n\"Keep shoveling coal into the furnace?\" Maya suggests as she leans back into her chair. Chioma is too taken aback by the casual disregard to loss of life to reply. \"You're right.\" Maya continues. \"But we're not stopping. We're reorienting.

Fear of losing the woman she loves keeps her from pushing harder as they stand on the edge of moral precipice together.\n\n'It is.'\n \n\"It is,\" Maya agrees aloud. \"We must treat it with caution, respect, and also… reverence.\" A thought crystallizes. \"We must treat it like a knife.\"","icon":null}},"3159160837":{"hash":3159160837,"index":2689,"redacted":false,"name":null,"iconImagePath":null,"colorImagePath":null,"displayProperties":{"name":"All-Star Mark","description":"The afternoon sun warms the courtyard's flagstones.

It was intact, the neck neatly severed, the eye clear and undamaged. \n\n\"Looks good,\" Failsafe said. The frame brought the cranium to the research table and plugged a complex network of wires into ports inside the Vex's head. The eye flashed a stuttering light and Failsafe flashed with it. \n\n\"I can handle it from here,\" Failsafe said. \n\nThe Vex cranium sparked and hissed for one sharp second before Failsafe quelled it with a quickly improvised script. The eye flashed again, then dimmed, then blinked out. \n\n\"Thank you, friend!\" Failsafe said to the frame, all cheer. \"You have been very helpful.\" \n\nThe frame gave a thumbs up and trilled a pre-recorded \"You're welcome!\" before moving out of the way, waiting for its next command. \n\nFailsafe focused on the Vex, peering into its mind. She relayed a series of command prompts to the incapacitated Vex, the execution of which gave her immediate access to three layers of encrypted data. \n\nIt wasn't enough. She had here a schematic of Nessus's interior, but nothing that her deeper scans hadn't already told her. The Vex's system was reflexively generating junk data as an immune response to her probing. She wrote a subroutine to garbage-collect it as she moved deeper inside the Vex mind. \n\nShe could see some of the deeper tunnels. Their dimensions, the volume of radiolaria. This Vex unit had overseen some of its construction, but that was centuries ago. The planet had shifted. New pathways had been dug, expanded, or rerouted. They went deeper. She struggled to interpret it. Failsafe was becoming crowded with useless data. The Vex unit was trying to overwhelm her. \n\nShe pushed forward. What she found surprised her. This Vex had been disconnected from a Mind for much longer than Failsafe had anticipated. It had collected its own individual data, interpreted it, collated it, and assimilated it on its own. It had completed tasks not at the behest of a Mind, but instead… \n\nAccess denied. \n\nFailsafe pulled back. \n\nThe AI watched in surprise as a self-contained data packet swiftly opened of its own accord and prompted itself to run. Failsafe's hard-coded defense mechanism slammed down, momentarily repelling the intrusive script. \n\n\"Disconnect! Disconnect!\" Failsafe shouted, and the frame rushed to the cranium, pulling out the wires it had connected only moments before. \n\nThere was a long silence but for the gentle whirr of a cooling fan. \n\n\"Huh.

I am just who I am, Failsafe. It does not take anything extra to be me.\" \n\n\"Oh!\" Failsafe exclaimed after a moment. \"How lovely that must be for you!\" Her sunny voice did little to hide her envy. \n\n\"Now for you, I understand it is different,\" Saint said, patting his helmet as if to soothe it. \"But I think that maybe you should not have to spend extra power to talk to your friends.\" \n\nA heavy silence fell over the comms.  \n\nFailsafe's voice was soft and reserved. \"Saint-unit?\" she said quietly. \n\n\"Yes?\" \n\n\"Did you once headbutt a Kell?\" \n\nSaint burst into laughter. \"I have headbutted many things!\" \n\n\"I'm checking on your files, and uh, yeah, you really have,\" Failsafe said.

You're not covering your tracks, and the Vanguard won't like you looking into Eramis's whereabouts. \n\nNote: Here the recording captures approximately three seconds of silence. \n\nEID: W-Well… I can't imagine the Vanguard would like what you're doing, either! Shall I tell them? \nSPI: Hah! Is this your first blackmail? Very sloppy, little Scribe. Come now, we're past this. You know I have your best interests at heart. \n\nNote: Here the recording captures one second of short, barked laughter from VIP #4143. \n\nEID: I don't believe—  \nSPI: That's not my problem. Why are you looking for Eramis? I've told you she isn't listening. \nEID: Eramiskel has lost a great deal of support—  \nSPI: Yes, yes. Her House is in shambles. What else? \nEID: I had hoped— \nSPI: This again? \nEID: I had HOPED— \nSPI: She's gone. For good this time. No House, no Witness. And from what I hear, even Xivu Arath has given up on her. \nEID: That's precisely why— \nSPI: Do you know your father talked to me about this obsession of yours? He wants this to stop, but he also knows you won't listen to him. \nEID: What? But she saved his life! \nSPI: And the debt is paid. Give up, Eido! It's pathetic. She doesn't care about you. She never has.\n\nNote: Here the recording captures eleven seconds of high-pitched wheezes punctuated by a staccato clicking noise from VIP #4143. \n\nSPI: Don't—I didn't— \nEID: You might not see the good in people, but I do. And I will never give that up. I don't want to live in a world where no one can change, and nothing can get better. Eramis needs to know that, and I won't stop trying to tell her. \n\nNote: Here the recording captures two seconds of a rolling, filtered sigh from VIP #1889.  \n\nCommunication ceases. \n\n4. I advise continuing to monitor #4143's personal logs. Any unauthorized and unsupervised contact with House Salvation could have dire consequences. \n\n5. Additionally, I advise approaching EKS-443 for greater cultural context on Eliksni non-verbal communication. \n\nMESSAGE ENDS","icon":null}},"4199629312":{"hash":4199629312,"index":2755,"redacted":true,"name":null,"iconImagePath":null,"colorImagePath":null,"displayProperties":{"name":"Classified","description":"Keep it secret.
