He needed the distraction, the work, but most of all he needed to be somewhere he could help. \n\nWhispers fly between them regarding the legend that addresses them, and the strange chicken that struts figure eights around his legs.\n\n\"This area is reserved for Lights without combat training who wish to take part in Solstice.

Some of you are familiar with this weapon,\" Saint says. \"For those who aren't familiar, it's very simple.\"\n\nHe quickly runs through a few exercises. How to reload quickly, adjust the sights, clear a jam. At the range targets, he demonstrates how to weave Light between bursts of gunfire. Each time, a metallic ping rings out as he strikes a target; and each time, a chicken-cluck response echoes beside him.\n\n\"Calm and discipline is key. Steady support of your rifle will keep it under control. Steady pressure on the trigger will keep you from pulling off-target. Breathe, squeeze, and shoot.\"\n\n\"Bawk.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes. Now it is your turn, New Lights!\"\n\nThe group steps forward and focuses on their targets. Several of the trainees' shots miss, but a Guardian in green lands each bullet and cheers.\n\n\"Bawk.\"\n\nThe New Light looks at the chicken now standing beside them, then to Saint-14, who also is focused on the chicken. There is a moment of hesitation before Saint says, \"Hm. Good. Run it again.\"\n\n\"I did it perfectly,\" the New Light complains flaccidly.\n\nSaint steps forward and puts a hand on their shoulder. \"Perfection doesn't guarantee success. Perfection is subjective, New Light. That's why we train.\"\n\n\"But I hit every one!\"\n\n\"Bawk… Awk!\"\n\nSaint-14 nods to the chicken, who stands tall and mighty—feathers sharp and puffed against the waning morning light.\n\n\"Colonel, the Pigeon Lord, says do it again.

To Zavala, Amani gave only a nod and a sad smile.\n \nSoon, the stone structures of the Iron Lord encampment rise on the horizon. \n \nZavala and Safiyah pass where they first found Hakim. The bodies are gone, the blood long soaked into the earth. The burned trees have new growth around their wounds. But the fragments of rusted wreckage along their path, picked over for any useful pieces, are still half-buried in the soil.\n \nAt the gates, Safiyah presses her knitting needles into his hands. \n \n\"To keep you warm,\" she says. He nods his head and thanks her, his voice small.\n \n\"You will survive this,\" she tells him. She knows he has no choice.\n \nSafiyah departs to find the people who need her. She feels Zavala's gaze cling to her until the gates of the Iron Lords disappear into the horizon.\n \n***\n \nThe gates of the encampment open for Zavala, alone. Saladin says little, passes no judgment, tenders no admonition. All he says to him is this:\n \n\"Love is a moment in time. We are not.\"\n \nZavala wonders, for an instant, if Saladin speaks from experience. He does not ask but simply takes a breath and follows Lord Saladin.\n \n***\n \nIt is decades until a message arrives from Amani—half crumpled and discolored from the uncertain journey it took to reach him in the Last City. \"Come quickly,\" it reads. \"Before it is too late.\"\n \nBut he arrives too late. \n \nAmani stands at the grave among the mourners, stooped, old. He nods to her, catching her eyes for a moment. A sad, familiar smile crosses her lips again before she returns the gesture in silent thanks.\n \nHe waits until most have left before he approaches the headstone. He holds a flower, picked on his journey. It was fresh when he found it, but its petals are bruised now as he gently places it on the churned earth of her grave.\n \nZavala rises and sees a woman standing beside him. They have the same eyes, warm and kind. Her daughter.\n \n\"How did you know her?\" she asks. His breath catches, unsure of how to answer a simple question from one mourner to another.\n \n\"I'm an old friend,\" he says, unable to keep the weariness from seeping into his words. The woman looks at him askance; he wonders, briefly, if she knows of him, his history. Her brother. But she simply nods and thanks him, and nothing more is said.\n \nYears later, he visits the woman's grave. Then her son's. Her son's son. The graveyard grows thick with headstones. He makes the journey each time.\n \nThey do not come to the Last City for 10 generations. The Hidden tell him when they are born, when they are sick, and when they die. He never speaks to them when they are alive, but at each grave, he leaves a token and a question: Can you forgive me?\n \nThe Red War does not claim them, but when the City grieves for those lost to the Vex and the Endless Night, Zavala grieves for the last of Safiyah's descendants. This time, there is no body for a grave.\n \nNow, Zavala sits at his desk. The knitting needles are worn with use. He holds them carefully, remembering how she had placed his fingers so that he could follow her movements. \n\nHe casts on a length of yarn and begins again.","icon":"/common/destiny2_content/icons/775cdcdfa2430430ae34b40eace883a7.png"}},"1866406133":{"hash":1866406133,"index":2028,"redacted":false,"name":null,"iconImagePath":null,"colorImagePath":null,"displayProperties":{"name":"RRHEXIS","description":"Zavala lays Hakim down on his bed, supporting him so that his head comes to rest softly on the pillow.

The blood of a deep, interior wound.\n \nZavala reaches for the edge of his son's blanket, adjusting it to cover Hakim's shoulder, carefully, as if he is afraid to wake him.\n \n***\n \n\"What will you do now?\"\n \nAmani has a way of cutting to the heart of things. Hakim has been buried for a month. Flowers on his headstone. The sisters sit, overlooking the graveyard. The night air is thick with summer warmth. All is silvered in the moonlight. The cicadas sing. The world does not stop and witness her grief.\n \nSafiyah shakes her head, silent. Her sister puts an arm around her shoulders.\n \n\"You will have to decide.\"\n \nThe silence grows heavy. She feels Amani draw her into an embrace.\n \n\"He was a good boy,\" her sister says, and Safiyah hears the quaver in her voice. \"Stubborn and brave, like his father.\"\n \nThey part, and Amani clasps Safiyah's hands in hers.

She follows the sound to their bedroom.\n \n\"Bring him back,\" he demands again. There is a tremor in Zavala's voice. Safiyah peers through the slip of space offered by the unlatched door. Her husband faces away from her, speaking to his Ghost.\n \n\"I can't,\" Targe says.\n \nTarge stares up at Zavala. She can see the Ghost shivering.\n \n\"Take my Light and bring him back.\" He struggles at every word.\n \n\"You know I can't.\"\n \n\"Would you?\" Zavala asks, something clawing into his voice. \"Would you bring him back, if you could?\"\n \nIf Targe speaks, Safiyah doesn't hear it. But she hears the scrape of Zavala's gun on the nightstand.\n \n\"Find a way. Bring him back,\" Zavala pleads.\n \nSafiyah doesn't hesitate when she sees Zavala raise the weapon. She swings open the door. Her husband flinches, turns, sees her standing at the threshold. Careful, she walks to him, puts a hand on his arm, lowers his gun. Zavala falls to his knees, the gun clattering to the floor.\n \nSafiyah reaches for Targe, and he floats to her. She holds him in her hands. There is a thrum, a warmth, in her palms. The Ghost's singular eye, pale blue, looks up at her. She remembers all the times he hovered just out of Hakim's reach, teasing him, playing with him. In that moment, she knows that Targe loved him too.\n \n\"We cannot change what happened,\" she whispers to her husband. \"This will not change who we are.\"\n \nShe thinks he will turn to her and ask, Who am I?

She is certain.\n\nSafiyah searches his face. She sees Hakim when she looks at him. She sees her own pain, reflected in his eyes. And she sees his pain as well, just as endless as the years he will suffer beyond her own. Safiyah looks away.\n \n\"I can't understand eternity,\" she says, sadly. \"I don't know if you can either.

The Guardians believe they have defeated your glorious emperor. How foolish. \n\nThey look at the bodies left in their wake and assume victory, at the blood and oil that runs from the battlefields they have ravaged and assume the territory conquered. They are like the old Cabal, sweeping over planets with no mind to the subjects that resist them. \n\nBut I am not so cruel. The worlds I brought into our fold were showered in riches, given everything for their service as Cabal… as you are now. As you will be each time you serve me. \n\nSome of you were born here. You are young, blessed by my hand with a life of celebrated battle and luxurious feasting. You fight with the voracity of veteran gladiators. You fight for your home—our home. I swell to call you my children.\n\nOthers came to me from my traitorous daughter, who calls herself empress even while I still draw breath. Such arrogance. Such disrespect. You've seen her tuskless plans fail Torobatl. You've watched her cast aside Cabal tradition to bow to the City and their Light. She fights alongside the very soldiers who slaughter your brethren, while I bend them to my will. Who is the true leader? The answer is clear. If only she had followed me as you do.\n\nFinally. Exalted most of all, you elite few who have stood with their emperor from the beginning, who grew fat with strength in exile: we are blood. As you have shed for me, I will shed for you. My flesh, my riches, my goblets of royal wine. They are yours. You are honored above all, and when our new Cabal stands before eternity, you will be among the first.\n\nI have heard the rumors whispered between you, my subjects. Rumors fed to you by our enemies. Your hope that I have not been vanquished is well placed, for I am so very much alive. You fear that we are defeated, but nothing could be further from the truth.\n\nYou wonder if I am a spirit, if I have become something beyond Cabal, if I have ascended like Acrius did when he cradled the sun in his grasp. Allow me to soothe your curiosity: yes, I have become all you have imagined, and so much more.\n\nThe Guardians believe they hold victory, but soon, they will see the truth they have ignored with such determination: this road is long, but it only has one end. They served to set my plans solidly in the foundations of the universe. Their petty attacks, while tragic in their costs to my dear crew, cannot halt our purpose.\n\nSo, my soldiers… I leave you this task: hold the Leviathan. Show no quarter to those who would walk the halls of your home as invaders. It is your final task before you may be uplifted to sit beside me at the end.\n\nI do not promise that every Cabal standing on the Leviathan will survive this journey, but under my loving watch, you will live and die in nothing less than greatness. What more can a warrior desire but an exciting life and a good death? Have I not given you both?\n\n\n-From the mouth of Amsot, High Scribe to the unbound emperor, Calus, who none can contain:\nRejoice! Praise Calus, who ascends.
