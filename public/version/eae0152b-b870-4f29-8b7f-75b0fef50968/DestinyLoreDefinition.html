Aisha looks around, spreading her hands. \n\n\"And Shayura isn't?\" \n\n\"She's coming. How long did you stick around the Stranger's camp after we left?\" Reed wonders. Aisha looks away at the Lighthouse across the courtyard. He fails to notice the tension in her posture. \n\n\"Couple hours. I moved around. House of Salvation was putting down stakes out near some Vex ruins; wanted to make sure they didn't stick,\" Aisha explains, bringing two fingers up to her neck, depressing a button on her armor's collar that summons her helmet around her head in a flash of light. \n\nReed snorts and nods. \"This is weird, right?\" he asks, dropping the topic of Europa. Aisha says nothing in response, waiting for Reed to quantify his assertion. \"The simulation. Saint's little… combat closet. It feels real. \" \n\n \"It is real. I mean, we are. The space is a… I don't know, magic? But me and you? The Guardians? We're all us. The dangers may be simulated, but that doesn't make the effects any less real. Saint wouldn't have it any other way,\" Aisha says, giving Reed an assessing look. \"You didn't go into the Infinite Forest, did you?\" \n\n\"Hell no,\" Reed quickly admits. \"Couldn't pay me enough to. Can't stand the Vex,\" he adds with a shudder. \"You know how you are with spiders? That's me with the Vex. Don't know why, don't care.\"\n\nWhatever Aisha was going to say is abruptly cut off when Shayura manifests into the simulated space mid-stride. She walks straight past Reed and Aisha toward the Lighthouse. \"Come on.\" \n\nShayura's brusque entrance elicits a concerned look between Reed and Aisha, but they say nothing more on the matter. \n\nSIMULATION RECONSTRUCTION LOG // LA-02-05 // SIMULATED TRIALS ARENA, SIMULATED LIGHTHOUSE\n\nReed's shoulder connects with a Guardian on the other team so hard, it breaks every bone in his opponent's chest and sends him straight through the wall. Reed pivots, turning to see Aisha firing her Hand Cannon through the torso of the other Guardian coming up on them with a pair of spectral blades drawn. She's been holding back and Reed can see it, all gunplay, none of her usual fire and flash. \n\n\"Where's Shayura?\" Reed asks as he reloads his Scout Rifle. Aisha points down a corridor with two fingers. \n\n\"She's been after that other Awoken Warlock since we started the match. I think she followed him that way,\" Aisha says, already breaking into a jog. \"It's three on one, c'mon.\" \n\nReed shakes his head, hurrying behind Aisha. He remembers what had happened the last time Shayura had broken off on her own. They shouldn't have come back to the Trials, not so soon, not after everything that's happened. Shayura pushed for this, trying to get the fireteam back to normal, but now he worries it was too early. \n\nWhen they finally find Shayura, she's standing over a still-living Awoken Guardian whose helmet has been broken, revealing one of his eyes. He stares up at her, at her fire-shrouded Sword. Aisha and Reed train their firearms, prepared to back Shayura up if she misses the finishing blow for the match. But Reed senses something is wrong. Shayura's sight line isn't aimed down at the Guardian; it's aimed up at her opponent's Ghost. \n\n\"Shay?\" Aisha asks, a nervous tremor in her voice. \n\nShayura lashes out, striking the Ghost with her Sword and knocking it to the ground. The Guardian exhales a scream of plight, and Shayura quickly draws her Sidearm and plants a round in his forehead. The Ghost chirps, squawks. It is only damaged. Shayura holsters her Sidearm again. \n\n\"Shay!\" Reed shouts, dropping his Scout Rifle and rushes over to her. This time, though, Shayura expels a blast of force from her palm that knocks Reed onto his back. She turns to the Ghost again, gripping her Sword in both hands, only to feel a sudden stabbing cold rise up her legs and arms. \n\nReed watches as blue-black ice crusts over Shayura's legs, snuffs out her fire, and freezes her arm solid, Sword and all. Feather-ice bristles off of her body along with waves of visible cold. Reed's focus snaps to Aisha, one hand extended and waves of cold emanating from her outstretched palm. She had saved the Ghost from Shayura, but the power she wields—he knows it isn't the Light. \n\nHe knows this will change everything.","icon":null}},"108221785":{"hash":108221785,"index":1717,"redacted":false,"name":null,"iconImagePath":null,"colorImagePath":null,"displayProperties":{"name":"Riiswalker","description":"A hurled bottle strikes an Eliksni in the head, sending him staggering to the side in a crowded street. Glass glitters on the ground. People gathered in a semicircle around him shout invectives and slurs, as he bleeds midnight blue from a deep cut in his brow. He has nowhere to run, cornered between a neon-lit club pulsing with the bass beats of rhythmic music and an alley blocked off by rubble left over from the Red War. \n\n\"Please, no harm. Vriiksis friend!\" he cries, two hands clutching his head, another held out flat as if it would ward the crowd off. \"Looking for brother—missing. Please!\"\n\nThe crowd does not care, and they continue to work themselves up into a fervor. Lakshmi-2's words fill their mouths, many of them too young or too naïve to realize it. Vriiksis can't understand so many unfamiliar languages shouted at him at once, but he understands the tone of violence well. His posture says everything—the fear in his eyes carries additional nuance. He fears what happened to his brother. Hate begins to take root in his heart.\n\nA foundry worker steps out of the crowd, threateningly racking a round into a Shotgun. He aims down at the Eliksni, hands trembling. \"You want to ask about family?!\" the Human yells. Vriiksis does not know what he's talking about. \"Your people kidnapped my sister! She was running supplies from Earth to Titan. You raided it!\"\n\n\"Vriiksis does not—\" He is cut off by a blast from the Shotgun that pulverizes the street beside him. Vriiksis crumples to his knees and cowers. \"Please,\" he says, and in the same motion, picks up a broken piece of the bottle he'd been hit with earlier to defend himself.\n\nThe crowd screams in outrage.\n\nWhen the foundry worker advances on Vriiksis and racks another round into the Shotgun, there is a sudden cold snap that fills the air with mist. The Shotgun flash freezes, shatters like glass, and scatters into pieces of blue-black Stasis. The worker recoils, clutching his half-frozen arm, screaming. \n\nVriiksis sees the crowd part behind his attacker, and a Hunter clad in black and gold with luminous markings on her armor strides toward them both. Darkness coalesces around her hand. Stasis crystals drift like tiny moons around her.\n\n\"That's enough!\" Aisha shouts. \"You should all be ashamed of yourselves! Look at you!\" \n\nAisha grabs the injured foundry worker by the collar with her free hand and shoves him back into the crowd. \"Clear out of here before I clear you out! Now!\" Wind swirls around Aisha's feet, kicking up crystalline debris in whirling threads of Darkness. The crowd recedes like a violent tide, some tripping over others in their haste to flee.\n\nAs the crowd disperses, Aisha dismisses the sickle of Stasis, and the swirling wind at her feet fades as well. She turns, looking at Vriiksis and offers a hand out to him. \"I'm sorry,\" she says with a tightness in her voice. He cannot see her expression behind the façade of her helmet.\n\nVriiksis does not take the offered hand. His eyes show the same fear. The same hate.\n\n\"It's okay,\" Aisha says slowly, offering her hand again. \"You're safe now, they're—\" \n\n\"Not safe,\" Vriiksis snaps at Aisha, his eyes dipping down to her hand and then back up to her helm. \"You are just like Eramis. Mind-poisoned.\"\n\nAisha's breath hitches in the back of her throat, and she slowly lowers the offered hand, closing gloved fingers into a briefly formed fist. \"You're hurt. At least let me escort you to a medical…\" Her voice trails off. Vriiksis is already backing down an alley, blue eyes locked on her. \n\nShe feels a weight on her shoulders, in her heart. \n\nThe Eliksni disappears into the shadows, leaving Aisha alone under an endless night's sky.","icon":null}},"139281387":{"hash":139281387,"index":1762,"redacted":true,"name":null,"iconImagePath":null,"colorImagePath":null,"displayProperties":{"name":"Classified","description":"Keep it secret.

The Hopeful Legion","description":"Val Ma'rag  had been \"stationed' in the place the Humans called a dead zone  for years now, though he had no commander, no handler . He held the territory on his own, defending it from the stinking, vermin Hive. They reminded him of the tiny red beetles that crawled around in the dust where he'd come up; the ones that swarmed war beast pens and crept into woven clothes. The best way to get rid of them, his mother taught him, was to hold a flame close to the seams of their shells. They snapped and popped in the heat.\n\nHe found the same to be true for the Hive. \n\nBy now, he'd stopped expecting anyone to come for him. Their invasion had become a death sentence; one he had accepted by the nature of his position. He would die for the Legion, with or without the promise of reward. \n\nAs Val Ma'rag listened to a transmission from the Empress Caiatl, he thought about how far he'd come since he was recruited. Since he was pulled out of the poorest rural district on his planet. With this new challenge—with the new empress sending her call out into the system—he could go a lot farther. \n\n///\n\nEuropa was cold. Basilius  was no stranger to cold—he'd been stationed on Mars before it disappeared, before his Valus  sent him and his reports off-planet on a recon mission. He didn't care for intel  or resource gathering, but a Valus is law. Or at least, he was. \n\nAfter a false start  on Nessus, they'd brought the cruiser to Europa. The icy moon was crawling with thieving Fallen, but there were secrets buried in the ice. Dainty Human technology. It didn't interest him, but the Psions loved to tinker, and they insisted there was something here worthwhile. \n\nSomething that could catch the attention of an empress hoping to regain favor with her scattered people. Something that might win a soldier like him, with no valuable titles or reputation to his name, a new level of recognition. \n\nAnd the respect he deserved. \n\n///\n\nAs the voice of their so-called empress droned on from a beat-up radio, the soldiers ate. Commander Dracus picked at the bones of a roasted bird, gun laid across his lap. The little red-violet winged creatures on Nessus didn't have much meat on them, but they were challenging and satisfying to trap. \n\n\"What's she mean, 'ancient rites'?\" a young Legionary asked. \n\nThe commander looked up. \n\n\"Old-timer traditions?\" she went on. \n\nDracus snorted. \"An honored tradition,\" he said. \"Beloved by the Praetorate . Warriors take on challengers to prove their battle-worth.\" He eyed her. \"Calves like you wouldn't remember that.\" \n\n\"Is it open to anyone?\" the Legionary asked. \n\nHe laughed. \n\n\"Well,\" she growled. \"Are you taking challengers?\" She squared her weight. \"You can start with me.\" \n\nDracus looked the bold youngling up and down, calculating the effort. He had no great desire to impress the disgraced emperor's pampered daughter. The leader he knew and served was the dominus , dead or alive. But maybe there was money to be gained from this. He wouldn't turn his nose up at the prospect. \n\nHe tossed the bird bones aside, lifted his gun, and fired a shot right into the Legionary's belly. She fell. \n\n\"I win,\" he said. \n\n///\n\nThey called her Ixel, the Far-Reaching because she'd risen far above her station in a fraction of her lifetime. \n\nThey called her Ixel, the Far-Reaching because she pulled things from her mind that should be out of reach from memory. \n\nThey called her Ixel, the Far-Reaching because she grasped for everything she could not have. \n\nIt was all true. On the strange terrain of the Nessus centaur, Ixel had extracted herself from command. The Valus had been uncreative, small minded. He hadn't seen the value in the Vex technologies that might amplify Ixel's unique Psionic talents. So she killed him and poached the unit's best fighters. \n\nHard to say if this competition was open to traitors of the empire. \n\nAnd yet somehow, this new empress, foolish though she was, might be inspired by bold action. \n\nNot to mention the things Ixel could pull from the prediction engines. Intelligence beyond the empress's imagining. \n\nThey called her Ixel, the Far-Reaching because her ambition was limitless.","icon":"/common/destiny2_content/icons/08c813a90a1d9b30848ecf0148392810.png"}},"217140611":{"hash":217140611,"index":1727,"redacted":false,"name":null,"iconImagePath":null,"colorImagePath":null,"displayProperties":{"name":"The Deicide","description":"Encoded private ping via HDN Proxy Router…\n\nIkora, thought you'd want to see this.

He had postponed this trip until the dead of night, when the only souls around would be as eager to avoid conversation as he was.

Of all his worries, this short walk had burdened him the most. His preoccupation ended with his arrival at the memorial. It was a hodgepodge of items, provided by both Humans and Eliksni. Zavala found their incongruity comforting. \n\nReaching out, he took a candle. He closed his eyes and cast his memory back to the day of her funeral. The smell of low tide and the rumble of thunderclouds on the horizon. He felt their static charge surge through the salt air and into his body. \n\nHe opened his eyes and the wick burst into flame. Zavala smiled. It was just the type of parlor trick she had always enjoyed.\n\nZavala placed the candle amongst its extinguished fellows, soothed by the tiny, flickering flame.

That they were content to live under the boots of the Vanguard, gnawing at scraps? Perhaps it was true for fools like Misraaks, his Awoken-raised hatchling, and cowards like the Empty Weaver. \n\nBut the Spider's acquiescence would not be so easily bought.

He wondered if there was a unifying thread binding all those events together. But he would have no time to ponder such things.\n\nA shadow crept over Mithrax: broad shoulders, a curling horn. Seeing the stark outline of Lord Shaxx looming on the stairs elicited centuries-old instincts, and it was temperance that kept Mithrax's hands from his weapon. \n\n\"I didn't expect to actually find you here,\" Shaxx said as he continued down the stairs with slow, plodding steps. \"Were you there?\"\n\n\"What?\" \n\nShaxx came to stand beside Mithrax at the railing. \"Were you there?\" he asked again. This time, he pointed, without looking, to a place on the horizon beyond the Traveler.\n\nMithrax followed Shaxx's gesture with his eyes. He did not understand. \n\n\"The Battle of Six Fronts,\" Shaxx insisted, with uncharacteristic softness. \"Do you know how many Fallen I killed there?\" \n\nMithrax bristled at the question, and he felt that instinctual urge to reach for his weapons again. But the presence of the Traveler and the question that nagged at the back of his mind stayed his hands. \"How many?\" he asked, not wanting to know the answer. \n\nShaxx deflated, folded his arms over the railing, and rested his considerable weight against it. \"Hundreds,\" he said quietly. \"All of them died afraid.\"\n\nMithrax felt Ether mixing with bile in the back of his throat. His limbs trembled, rage burned in his gut, demanding manifestation. But he tempered his anger, sighed so deep that the Ether on his breath was briefly visible as an iridescent cloud.\n\n\"How many Humans have you killed?\" Shaxx wondered.\n\n\"Too many,\" Mithrax answered, and even that felt insufficient on his tongue; the thought of it twisted his insides around. He sighed again, deeper this time, and Shaxx watched the sublimated Ether glitter in the dim light. \n\n\"When I heard you were in the Tower,\" Shaxx said, \"I thought I'd just throw you over the edge of the wall. I thought about the people I watched die at the hands of your Houses over the years.

Huddled together in a collapsed storm drain. They had stolen food during a… a time of famine. Maybe it was for themselves, maybe another settlement, maybe family…\" Shaxx shrugged. \"I killed them. All three, with my bare hands.\"\n\n\"My victims were Humans too,\" Shaxx clarified, and the Kell felt his anger twist into confusion. \"I was a Warlord in the Dark Ages. Convinced myself of the necessity of my own barbarism by painting it with noble colors. Those loyal to me built a legend that masked the blood and the rot. But it's still there.\" He tapped his fingers against his breastplate. \"Deep down.\"\n\nThe shadows had become long, stars now visible in the sky, and the Traveler was cast in half shadow.\n\n\"There was a ship,\" Mithrax eventually replied. \"It may have been soldiers. Civilians. I do not know.\" He looked away from the Traveler as he spoke. \"I led a boarding party onto it. We slaughtered any who resisted and rounded up those who surrendered.\"\n\nShaxx turned to look at Mithrax, a wordless question in his faceless mask.\n\n\"We argued what to do with the prisoners. Some suggested we keep them as warning-trophies. Others said to barter with them.\" Mithrax looked away, shoulders sagged. \"But I was young. Impatient.\" He closed his eyes. \"I opened the airlock. It seemed the simplest solution.\"\n\nBoth soldiers sank into silence again and remained so as the last glimpse of sunlight descended beyond the horizon. Shaxx sullenly took his leave, and Mithrax was left with the remnants of anger and confusion, and paradoxically—an answer.\n\nHe saw then the thread of choices leading to this moment. The choices that led to the Great Machine and away from a fate like Eramis had suffered. It was something both he and Shaxx learned to accept in spite of a lifetime of experience telling them otherwise.\n\nMercy.","icon":null}},"343482208":{"hash":343482208,"index":1757,"redacted":true,"name":null,"iconImagePath":null,"colorImagePath":null,"displayProperties":{"name":"Classified","description":"Keep it secret.

The former Guardian read dispatches from Spider's Associates with one eye and watched his runners scurry about with the other. \n\nThe younger kids took bets from all over the City and delivered them to Prak'kesh at appointed intervals. Once the action paid off, the bookie would send the older kids to settle up. Any incalcitrant debtors were dealt with by Tulnik, his enormous ex-Corsair bodyguard, who was currently leaning against the Tower, scratching himself. \n\nPrak'kesh chirped a low call to Tulnik, who snapped to attention. A fireteam was gliding toward them from across the courtyard. The Guardians' cloaks billowed in a non-existent wind, and their feet barely touched the paving stones. Prak'kesh rolled his eyes. Warlocks. \n\nPrak'kesh called out, \"Looking sharp. I love the… bird… hat.\" \n\n\"This is Felwinter's Helm, jackass,\" the Voidwalker fired back. \"Prolly costs more than your Sparrow.\" \n\n\"Good,\" Prak'kesh retorted, \"then you've got the cash to pay your debts. Val Guscu wasn't quite the mad dog you thought she was.\" \n\nThe Warlocks glanced at each other surreptitiously. \"About that,\" said the Dawnblade, \"we don't have the Motes… yet.\" \n\nTulnik, sensing his moment, stepped forward with a menacing flex. Prak'kesh stayed his enforcer with a manicured hand. \"Steady, Tully. These are learned scholars. I'm sure they have a needlessly complex plan to make things right.\" \n\n\"We do,\" said the Stormcaller through gritted teeth. \"Double or nothing on the Guardian Games Crucible this week.\" \n\nPrak'kesh gave a low whistle. \"That's some heavy action. Who you backing?\" \n\n\"Us,\" the Dawnblade responded. \"Against Meliorea's Titans.\" \n\nPrak'kesh's eyebrows shot up. \"Meliorea's at the top of the leaderboards. She's dangerous. And you guys are… stylish. It's a bad bet. Unless,\" the bookie tapped the side of his nose, \"you know something I don't.\" \n\nThe Voidwalker tossed her head, as if flicking her hair. Then, realizing she was still wearing her helmet, awkwardly put her hands on her hips. \"Let's just say she's about to have a bad case of existential dread the night before the match.\" \n\nThe Warlocks snickered. \"Little trick I picked up from the Psions,\" the Voidwalker finished. \n\n\"Titans put all their armor on their chests,\" the Dawnblade opined, \"and none between their ears. Like a castle with no roof.\" \n\nThe Voidwalker guffawed. \"Is that why they always look like they're getting rained on?\" \n\nThe Stormcaller dropped his voice an octave, puffed out his chest, and lumbered around on bowed legs. \"When the only tool you have is a Titan, every hammer is a nail!\" \n\n\"Indeed!\" the Warlocks chortled and high fived. \n\n\"It's settled, then!\" Prak'kesh pulled out his datapad. \"You guys beat Meliorea this week, and the slate's clean. Otherwise, I get the Motes,\" he said and winked at the Voidwalker, \"and that fancy hat.\" \n\nThe Voidwalker was suddenly serious. \"Guys. No. Come on,\" she implored her teammates. \"You know how many engrams I had to—\" \n\n\"Deal,\" the Dawnblade interrupted.

Most seemed to fit into the final category. He smiled; history had taught him the quiet ones were always the most dangerous.\n\nHe reached the center of the tight knot and found three Eliksni sitting at a table, trying to ignore the crowd around them. Undaunted, he pushed his way onto the chair arm of the biggest Eliksni like a feral cat. The Eliksni growled, but Drifter tossed Trust into the center of the table with a heavy thud.\n\nDrifter turned toward the crowd. \"What's got you fine folk all riled up tonight?\"\n\n\"Take it you don't listen to the radio much,\" someone said, and the crowd laughed.\n\n\"Places I like tend to have bad reception,\" Drifter replied. \"Tell me what I missed.\"\n\nThe group all spoke at once, a cacophony of accusations.\n\n\"Whoa!\" cried the Drifter. \"Seems like some of you been spendin' too much time starin' at that fake night.\" He turned to the Eliksni.\n\n\"Now somewhere in this commotion, I think I heard shoutin' of missing equipment. So, I've gotta ask,\" he said. \"You fellas been takin' what don't belong to you?\"\n\nThe big Eliksni spoke. His voice was deep and steady. \"We had confusions with your people. Where was self-supply and where was all-supply.\" He shrugged. \"We learned, and we compensated.\"\n\nDrifter nodded. \"Makes sense for settlin' into a new place. Ain't a soul here who hasn't checked their neighbor's toolshed for spare SMG parts.\"\n\nA voice spoke, \"Hey, I'm missing an SMG—\" But Drifter held up a hand.\n\n\"And I don't wanna hear they caught any blame for the big night. I swear, it's like some folk's brains just wilt in the dark. I know Mithrax is workin' with the Vanguard to figure out this whole Vex thing,\" he said.\n\nThe Eliksni seemed to relax a bit, but Drifter held up a finger. \"I do have one question of my own,\" he said. \n\n\"We've been fightin' for a long time, your folk and mine. That's no secret. Plenty of blood spilled on both sides over the years. But I hear stories some of you fellas from the old days caught the hunger.\"\n\nThe big Eliksni shifted tensely in his seat as the crowd pressed in.\n\nDrifter leaned in closer, his voice gravelly. \"Nasty rumor even says you guys chomped on the occasional toddler.\"\n\nThe Eliksni pushed his chair back and lunged to his feet as the crowd gasped. Drifter stood his ground, somehow staring down the Eliksni that was a full meter taller than him.\n\n\"Never your young!\" the Eliksni boomed. \"Never.\"\n\nDrifter nodded. \"But the rest?\"\n\nThe Eliksni looked at the crowd, then brought his massive head close to Drifter. His voice was steady. \"We old ones, we who have been fighting since the beginning… yes. We sometimes took your dead fighters so that we could live.\"\n\n\"It was war,\" he said, and poked at Drifter's chest with a clawed finger. \"And you are made of meat.\"\n\nDrifter smiled. \"I hear you, brother,\" he said, and looked at the Eliksni's claw. \"Hell, you point that thing at me, all I can think is how good it'd taste with garlic butter. Mm-mmm!\" He leaned toward the looming creature and ran his tongue over his chapped lips. \n\nThe Eliksni sized up the tiny man, then dropped his shoulders. \"But as I say, that was long ago,\" he said. \"We are House Light now, and forever more. We have peace with your people.\"\n\nDrifter reached up and patted the Eliksni's chest. \"That's right,\" he said, and the Eliksni sat down. \"And though it don't erase the bad old days,\" he said as he turned to the crowd, \"that don't mean it's time to bring 'em back.\"\n\nA dissatisfied grumble rose from the crowd. The fight had gone out of them. \n\nThe Eliksni shrugged. \"Misraaks says we are never to eat people again,\" he said quietly.\n\nDrifter nodded. \"Yeah, Zavala tells me the same damn thing.\"\n\nThe Eliksni burst into coughing laughter.

He groaned, slid off his cot, and slumped into the pilot's chair. Large amounts of data streamed across an array of thick glass screens while the alarm blared. He connected all the various details: heavy interference on scanners, propulsion malfunction in the main drive, erroneous flags on the proximity detectors. He looked through the porthole, a glass circle no more than five inches wide, and saw wisps of blue particulates wash past.\n\n\"Collision?\" he pondered.\n\nA voice called out behind him. \"Still days out from the belt, nothing here to hit.\"\n\nEkris pivoted around and saw his copilot. He squinted, trying to remember the other Eliksni's name, but nothing came to him. He felt bad about that. They'd been in transit awhile and he still couldn't remember this one's name.\n\n\"It's Raksil,\" the copilot said as he focused on the instrument displays. \"You make that face every time you forget my name.\"\n\nEkris looked away in shame. \"Strange coincidence. Had a brother Raksil.\"\n\n\"There are many Raksil-brothers and Ekris-pilots, if you look far enough,\" the copilot said.\n\nEkris wasn't convinced that was true, but it wasn't important.\n\n\"Drive is down,\" Ekris said. \"Stuck in a field of something.\"\n\n\"Not stuck,\" Raksil said as he punched in some commands through the dash controls, stopping the alarm. \"Just slow. Velocity steady.\"\n\n\"No control…\" Ekris chittered nervously. \"If we're lucky, we'll drift out eventually.\"\n\n\"Long road just to get to Misraaks.\" Raksil sat on the bulkhead and sighed. \"You still think he's Kell of Kells?\"\n\nEkris' mind buzzed with an odd sensation. He didn't remember sharing that with his copilot.\n\n\"Best chance I've seen,\" he said. \"He is different, brings us together in new ways.\"\n\nRaksil made a click with his mandible. \"Heard that before.\"\n\nEkris waved his claw dismissively. \"You always dissent, just to be a dissenter.\"\n\n\"I want to free you from this obsession,\" Raksil replied.\n\nEkris scoffed. \"Kell of Kells is a symbol of hope for all Eliksni. You would rather we live without that?\"\n\n\"This myth divides us, brother,\" Raksil said. \"We rend and tear, trying to claw our way to the top of the mountain. Then we look down and see the mountain is made of our torn banners.\"\n\nSomething itched in Ekris's mind. Did Raksil just call him \"brother\"?\n\nRaksil continued his thought. \"The only unity down this path is collective death. The Kell of Kells is destined to rule only the House of Silence.\"\n\nEkris clicked his jaw angrily. \"Why would Eliksni dream of this Kell, if the dream only harms us?\"\n\n\"Maybe we didn't,\" Raksil said with a devilish grin. \"Maybe something else dreamt it for us. To keep us apart.\"\n\nEkris waved his claws and stood, pacing around the cabin. \"Enough. You are stretched thin by this journey; you need more sleep—go to your bunk.\" His mind itched again. There was only one cot in the ship. He stumbled as the dizziness overcame his senses. When he looked up, he was alone.\n\n\"You've chased this dream so long you've forgotten you're asleep,\" Raksil said, a hint of mourning in his voice—the sound came from nowhere in particular. The pilot's console was dim and quiet. The instrument readouts had slowed and showed no warnings.

A haphazard collision of heavy canvas and metallic weave draped over its shoulders. A Vanguard lanyard dangled absurdly from its neck. \n\nIt was small for an Eliksni, but its angular head still towered above Maurice as it hunched over the bar. Four blue eyes looked back at him from above a lipless mouth. It opened, revealing rows of thin, sharp teeth. \n\n\"One item ramen soup,\" the Eliksni croaked stiltedly. \"Please.\" \n\nMaurice held his breath, tightened his grip on his pencil, and grinned. He grinned when he was nervous, and this seemed like as good a time as any. \n\nThe Eliksni grinned back, nodded, and then opened its horrible mouth again. \"I smelled it, and the smell was good,\" it said.\n\nMaurice scanned the bar. His other customers sat frozen, their bowls of ramen steaming silently in front of them. He realized his mouth had apparently decided to talk on its own, as if nothing were wrong. He heard himself ask, \"How spicy, zero to five stars?\"\n\nThe Eliksni had anticipated this question. \"Spicy five stars,\" it said, holding up one hand with three claws splayed, and another with two. \"May I receive additional dead flesh, please?\"\n\n\"You got it,\" Maurice said, his even voice betraying none of his tension, and he turned back to the bubbling pot of broth. Muscle memory took over, and he soon found himself placing a steaming bowl of ramen in front of the creature, who clucked cheerfully.\n\nMaurice took a half-step back. A small crowd was forming in the walkway in front of the restaurant. Some of the customers leaned in as their curiosity overcame their terror. Maurice noticed the woman in seat 2 needed more water, but it could wait. \n\nThe Eliksni raised its arms tentatively, then looked to Maurice again. \"What is the protocol?\" \n\nMaurice found himself unsure of which pair of the Eliksni's eyes to look into and focused on the ramen instead. \"Well, you eat the noodles and pork and egg with—\" \n\n\"Egg,\" repeated the Eliksni, enjoying the unfamiliar word.\n\n\"—yeah, egg. You eat all that with the chopsticks, and you get the broth with the spoon.\" Maurice saw how the Eliksni's claws dwarfed the ceramic spoon. \"Or you can just lift the whole bowl and drink it.\"\n\nMaurice mimed lifting a bowl to his lips. The Eliksni nodded. Its claws tapped the metal on its face and the hissing blue mist ceased. \n\nThe Eliksni held the chopsticks, tested their weight, and respectfully placed them back on the bar before bringing the bowl to its mouth with its upper arms. Above the ramen bowl, Maurice saw all four of the Eliksni's eyes close. \n\nA long moment of tension fell over the shop, the silence broken only by a staccato series of hissing slurps.\n\nFinally, the Eliksni lowered the empty bowl. It breathed in as the blue mist resumed its thin spray. It looked toward Maurice. \"I tasted all of it,\" it said with deep satisfaction. \"I am very thankful.\"\n\nMaurice's grin turned into a tentative smile. \"Glad you enjoyed it.\" \n\nThe Eliksni stood and held out what looked like a small model of the Traveler. It glowed as it floated in the Eliksni's palm. \"Compensation,\" it said.\n\nMaurice reached to take the treasure, then drew his hand back. \"For new customers, there is no charge,\" he said. \"No compensation.

Waves of golden fire lap at the sides of her face. \n\nReed doesn't say anything as his companions arrive. They're doing enough talking for everyone on Mercury, so he gives them their space, choosing instead to focus on the task at hand. He moves toward the looming structure of the Lighthouse and the Guardians gathered outside, waiting in their queue to compete in the prestigious Trials of Osiris. \n\nHis Ghost looks at him with concern; Reed reassures him with a gentle tap of his finger against the Ghost's shell. But Reed can hear his friends becoming increasingly frustrated with one another. Arguments like this have happened before: Is Eris trustworthy? Should the Vanguard track down Cayde's murderer? Was Cayde's death his own fault for being so reckless? Their disagreements had always ended with understanding. Today, however, things feel different. \n\n\"Hey!\" Reed turns and shouts back at them. It's louder than he intended. The bright red Exo recoils a little from the volume of his own voice. The clap of his rebuke distracts both Warlock and Hunter. They look up at him in sudden silence. \n\nReed lifts a hand to the back of his neck, scratching sheepishly. \"Can we do this later? Please?\" \n\nShayura and Aisha afford each other a brief and mild look. Wordlessly, they put away their conversational weapons for another time. Shayura draws a Sword and points it across the windswept courtyard toward a group of Guardians, indicating a challenge. \n\n\"Fine,\" Aisha agrees reluctantly. \n\nReed will take that as a victory, however small.","icon":null}},"1319537767":{"hash":1319537767,"index":1755,"redacted":true,"name":null,"iconImagePath":null,"colorImagePath":null,"displayProperties":{"name":"Classified","description":"Keep it secret.

Showering sparks rained down on her clothes and bare arms, mutedly reflected in her welding goggles. The prickling sensation of the sparks on her skin was comforting, familiar. So too was the half-finished Sparrow refit her new assistant was working on. But the assistant? That was taking some getting used to.\n\n\"I don't know why this is so surprising,\" Amanda said as she looked over at the Eliksni Vandal working a pair of arc-welders held in four hands. She laughed to herself, rubbing her cheek as a spark bounced off it. \"Always wondered how y'all built stuff so fast.\"\n\nThe Eliksni engineer—Niik—winked three eyes in Amanda's direction before returning her attention to the welding work. \"Easier see too. No eye-shields,\" Niik explained with a smile. \"Eliksni eyes-quick better than Human.\" Then, quieter, \"Not as much as before-home, but…\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" Amanda wondered. Niik stopped welding, set her tools down, and reclined back with two hands on the concrete floor and two folded in her lap. She looked up at the ceiling and sighed a faint Ether mist.\n\n\"Story-lives greater than now-true selves,\" Niik explained, then looked sidelong at Amanda. \"We all lost purpose after…\" Niik carefully considered the proper Human words, \"…our Golden Age.\"\n\nIt was Amanda's turn to sigh, more so in regret than Niik's sigh of patience. \"You ever ridden a Sparrow before?\" she asked in an attempt to change the tone of the conversation. She hadn't considered the question before asking it.\n\nNiik shook her head and focused her attention on the half-finished machine in front of her. \"Too small,\" she said with a shrug of her upper shoulders. \"Pikes stronger, but quick-run.\"\n\nAmanda couldn't help but laugh at that. \"Darlin',\" she said through the laughter, \"ain't no Pike faster than my Sparrow.\" \n\nNiik's eyes lit up, and she sat forward at the perceived challenge. Amanda remembered the last radio conversation she had with Crow, an Eliksni phrase he used. A friendly challenge. Her pronunciation was not quite right, but the intention was. Niik delighted at the interaction.\n\n\"Your boasts are hollow-hull,\" Niik said with a growl of laughter and clambered up onto one knee. Amanda's eyes widened for just a moment when it looked like Niik was going to pounce on her. As if she had somehow said the wrong phrase or challenged the Vandal to a duel. No weapons were drawn, however. Instead, Niik offered two hands to help Amanda up from the floor; she pulled her up with ease.\n\n\"Are we gonna… race?\" she asked with a nervous flutter of laughter and crooked smile. \n\nNiik nodded enthusiastically. \"Yes, race.\"","icon":null}},"1621558458":{"hash":1621558458,"index":1715,"redacted":false,"name":null,"iconImagePath":null,"colorImagePath":null,"displayProperties":{"name":"Gridskipper","description":"He heard something and snapped awake.

That didn't mean anything—they could turn invisible. Everyone knew that. They could just be standing there, one or two, or a dozen, staring down at him.\n\nHe looked for shimmering outlines, but his vision was filled by the swaying grid of the dark purple night. He squinted as a ripple rolled high overhead, and the grid seemed to move closer, like an enormous sheet settling over the City.\n\nA wave of pressure pushed down, building in his sinuses. He pressed a hand to his eyes. A deep thrum filled his head, and he heard their claws on the walls all around him, their hissing laughter.\n\nHe turned toward the street, weapon raised. He felt his heart thudding in his chest and sweat beading on his back.\n\nAnother noise: someone pounding on glass behind him.\n\nHe spun and one of them was in his house, looking out at him through the window.

She had just left a debriefing on the previous night's sabotage of the Eliksni camp. With each detail, her blood pounded more forcefully in her ears and the Light tingled in her fingertips. Now, striding across the elevated catwalk, her temper nearly lifted her off the ground in righteous fury. \n\nSuddenly a deep, familiar voice broke through the tumult: \"Anger bends the mind, as gravity bends space-time. It's a form of distortion—useful, but dangerous.\" Ikora turned, half expecting to find Osiris standing behind her. But she was still alone. \n\n\"Like gravity, once anger reaches a critical mass, it collapses in on itself, and not even Light can escape.\" Ikora smiled to herself. Even in absentia, her mentor always knew just what to say. \n\nIkora Rey ducked into an alcove and sat with her back against the cool stone of the Tower. She closed her eyes and listened to her breath. Concentrated on slowing her heartrate. Felt her muscles loosen. \n\nOnce her body was stilled, she completed one of the many meditations Osiris taught her when she first began her training. She felt the Light moving through her body: first as a raging fire, then as a rushing river, and finally as a cool breeze. By the time she opened her eyes, her mind was clear and sharp. \n\nShe was prepared to face her opponent. \n\nII. \n\nSaint-14 was doing munitions inventory when Osiris swept into the room. Saint put down his datapad next to a crate of grenades and stood up. Osiris scanned the shelves of guns and ammo, looking for something. \n\nSaint stood dumbly, waiting for some kind of acknowledgement. When it was clear that none was forthcoming, he called out, \"Osiris. What are you looking for?\" His voice was loud and strained. \n\nOsiris didn't turn from the shelves. \"The Light suppressor that the Psions used on Zavala's Ghost. I need it for my research.\" \n\n\"Zavala kept it, I think. Ask him about it,\" Saint replied, trying not to sound put out. \n\nOsiris faced his partner, his eyes narrowed in thought. \"Very well.\" Then, as an afterthought, \"Thank you.\" \n\nAs the former Warlock turned to leave, Saint called out, \"I was hoping we could spend some time together soon. Just the two of us.\" \n\n\"Doing what?\" Osiris inquired with a small smile. \n\n\"We could fly out to the Alps,\" Saint suggested. \"Or walk around the ruins of Prague. Like we used to.\" \n\n\"That seems fine,\" Osiris said. He shrugged a shoulder. \"Provided the City doesn't burn to the ground in our absence.\" Then after a beat: \"Is that all?\" \n\nIs that all? Behind his helmet, Saint frowned. \"I suppose.\" \n\nOsiris strode from the room, leaving Saint alone with a sinking feeling in the pit of his stomach. \n\nIII. \n\nLakshmi-2 watched Osiris from across the bustling courtyard. Of all the political creatures in the Tower, he was the one that troubled her most. \n\nHer concern was not a matter of the ex-Warlock's unpredictability. In fact, it was just the opposite. \n\nThe Device had no trouble parsing his arrogant brilliance—his every move was well within the standard deviation. \n\nYet for someone with a legendary reputation as an eccentric, his every move as of late had been shockingly moderate. It was his newfound predictability that bothered her. \n\nPerhaps the loss of his Ghost had affected him more than anyone understood. Maybe the burden of mortality had sapped his courage. \n\nIt was also possible that Osiris represented a blind spot in the Vex dataset; something that only a Human could comprehend. Or perhaps instead, something obvious to the Vex overlooked by her Human mind. \n\nWhatever the case, Osiris bore watching the old-fashioned way. At least until his usefulness played out.","icon":null}},"1724366537":{"hash":1724366537,"index":1684,"redacted":false,"name":null,"iconImagePath":null,"colorImagePath":null,"displayProperties":{"name":"Pyrrhic Ascent Gauntlets","description":"SIMULATION RECONSTRUCTION LOG // LA-02-03 // BAZAAR, THE TOWER, LAST CITY\n\nThe noise of the Bazaar is a background hum, seemingly electrical but performed by so many organic systems.  Reed-7 finds comfort in the banality of human conversation when viewed at a macro level—the impression of life. It's something other than language to him, something he imagines the universe might sound like to a Warlock. At least, he assumes they hear those things. \n\nThere is relief that in this moment,  Reed hears only the people in the Bazaar, not the voices of horror that haunt him from Io's cradle. When he thinks too hard about it, he can still hear the Darkness moaning through his Ghost. Rather than dwell on it, he searches for something else to fixate on, something to distract him. \n\nThe whole of the Bazaar is decorated for the Festival of the Lost, with colorful engram-shaped ornaments hung from decoratively macabre trees. A Ghost—one he's fairly certain belongs to the Warlock Osiris—goes cartwheeling by with a shriek of laughter, trailing cloth wrappings in her wake. The moment of levity helps lift Reed's spirits as he returns to his table in New Monarchy's enclosure where Aisha and Shayura wait for him. \n\n\"Drinks,\" Reed says, setting down three tall mugs wafting with steam. Aisha offers him a supportive but strained smile. \"Careful,\" he notes as she reaches for a mug, \"they're hot.\" He'd earned the nickname Strike-Dad thanks to obvious and well-meaning cautions like that. \n\n\"There's cinnamon in yours,\" Reed says to Shayura, who may be asleep, her head down on the table atop her folded arms. Shayura has the wherewithal to give him a distracted thumbs-up. It's at least comforting, if not wholly reassuring. Aisha gives Reed a wordless look of concern and shakes her head. Their talk had not gone well while he was away. \n\n\"I know you're upset about Sloane,\" Reed says, deciding to tear off that conversational bandage. \"But you know the commander's done all he can. We've done all we can. Don't blame yourself for—\"\n\n\"Thanks,\" Shayura says without looking up. She sits up enough to grab her steaming mug with two hands and drag the piping hot cider over to herself. She slouches over the mug, breathing in the aroma of cinnamon, honey, apples, and cloves. Her eyes drift shut, and for a moment, she seems more herself. \n\nAisha and Reed take a moment to breathe. Give Shayura time to breathe. \"I know,\" Shayura finally says in a small, guilty voice. \"I'm sorry.\" It's hard to tell if she's talking about Sloane, or about her behavior in general. \n\n\"You don't need to apologize to us,\" Reed says with a look to Aisha, finding her approval. \"You should apologize to Leitka  and his Ghost.\" \n\n\"It was Titan,\"  Shayura finally says, staring into her mug. Reed and Aisha look at each other, but neither interrupts. They let her reach that point at her own pace. \"I was back on Titan. Like when we were Lightless, surrounded by Hive.  There was this Knight… no matter how many times I killed him, he kept coming back.  I should've died out there.\" \n\n\"But you didn't,\" Aisha says, reaching out across the table to take Shayura's hand, giving it a reassuring squeeze. \"We got our Light back, and—\"\n\n\"What happens when the Darkness closes in?\" Shayura asks, though she knows neither Reed nor Aisha have the answer. \"Will she  be Lightless again? Alone?\" \n\nReed and Aisha share a look, and the Exo reaches across the table to lay one of his large hands on Shayura's, atop Aisha's. He doesn't have a rousing speech, strong words, or even cold comforts. He just has his presence to offer in support of her traumas. \n\nHe has to hope that's enough.","icon":null}},"1751782730":{"hash":1751782730,"index":110,"redacted":false,"name":null,"iconImagePath":null,"colorImagePath":null,"displayProperties":{"name":"Stormcaller","description":"The hurricane battered me with a ferocity beyond any foe I had met, battered harder than the roiling chaos in my mind that drove me here, to the ends of the system, in search of— \n\n\"Calm,\" whispered the Voidwalker. \"Burn!\" roared the Dawnblade.

He knows his Ghost is still talking, but he's effectively tuned it out. \n\nAisha and Shayura are on a lower terrace, far enough away that Reed can't hear them talking, just observe their body language. Both look tense, Shayura most of all. But for all that Reed wants to watch them, he can't seem to keep his eyes away from the Traveler—from the seething waves of blue-white light that erupt from inside its cracked shell, from the way the waves make him feel as they wash over him. It is a vindication to his hope, that the Traveler would not abandon humanity in their hour of need. He wants Shayura to see that, to feel his faith, but each time he looks at her, she seems more distant. \n\n\"Reed.\" His Ghost says for the fifth time. Reed finally acknowledges his name, looking at his Ghost with uneasy silence. \"I feel… strange. Something's happening.\" It's more a plea to the Guardian than anything. A plea of uncertainty and helplessness. Even his Ghost couldn't tell if the coming tide was going to wash them all away; if this was how the final moments of the Collapse were felt.

His family. \n\nWhen the light fades, when his optic sensors recalibrate , he is moved to simulated tears. The Traveler hangs like a moon over the City. Whole.

Evidently taking the day off, just when it was most inconvenient.\n\nThe Hidden agent crouched, running her hand over the smooth stones cluttering the shore. She was hoping to have good news for her next report. Ikora looked so tired at their last check-in.\n\nNo wonder. Even before the Pyramids arrived, it felt like their enemies were multiplying at the same rate their allies were decreasing. Now, with four celestial bodies stolen out of the sky, that trend seemed to be accelerating.\n\nAnd here she was, following a tenuous lead on the whereabouts of the infamous Light Kell into a dead zone.\n\nShe briefly considered turning her radio on and checking in, but then she saw it: the ideal skipping stone, palm shaped and perfectly worn. She picked it up, and with a well-timed flick, sent it spinning across the water. The mirror image of blue sky and pine tree tops rippled once, twice, six times before gravity outweighed momentum, pulling the stone beneath the surface.\n\nSuddenly, a frenetic rustling broke out all around her. The trees quivered as hundreds of birds burst forth, shrieking in alarm as they circled in the sky. Chalco whipped around, rifle at the ready, but there was no one. She slowed her breathing, ears open for the telltale whine of speeding Pikes.\n\nThe wispy hairs on the back of her neck stood at attention as the air crackled with electricity. A great rumbling threw Chalco off her feet. She rolled as she hit the ground. The second shockwave arrived while she was facedown—a louder and more definitive thud that caused the rocks to jump up and fall back down with a clatter.\n\nSilence returned. When she lifted her head, all seemed as it had moments ago…\n\n…except for the once-clear sky, now streaked with aurorae of many colors.\n\nChalco leapt up and ran for the ravine wall. She scaled it, then the nearest pine in a matter of seconds. A risky move considering the possibility of aftershock, but she needed height.\n\nIt wasn't until she reached the wavery top branches that she saw it. Cresting over the tree line was the Shard of the Traveler, bleeding polychrome rays. Chalco turned her gaze up, following the arc into the stratosphere. What was happening?\n\nKeeping her eyes fixed on the sky, she flipped on her radio. Immediately, Eris Morn's voice echoed over the Vanguard's public frequency: \"This will not be the end. It will be an escalation.\"\n\nA flash, piercing in its brilliance, lit up the southeastern sky. Chalco braced herself against the tree, squeezing her eyes shut.

Hear the story of the Ether-blood Lightbearer. The one who wields Ethraaks's blades. She wandered a troubled Shore with vengeance in her heart, searching for the one who had wronged her: the devil-turned-spiderling, Driksys. Food and Ether we shared. The House of Light once again found peace with a Guardian, yes?\n\nHLS: We know of Driksys. One who always thirsted for power, cursed machines, Dark flows of energy, it made no difference. This time, he sought power through Cabal; Legion-rumors of vile splinters from Europa filled his mind with temptations.\n\nHLS: Cabal roamed the Shore, battering against one another in displays of might. Like the Kells of old, they fought for the claim to supremacy… to serve Caiatl of the dead-world fleet. Driksys saw many Kells come and go. Driksys understood fragile loyalties. Understood importance of strength seen. Driksys offered Legion use of his ring for their challenges, and from Cabal blood, he drew profit.\n\nHLS: I stood with Driksys before the House of Light. This one saw him weave truthless words to collect promises. Contacts on Europa. Introductions. Shipments. Brought to Spider, entire ring would have died… many Eliksni lose. When the Ether-blood Lightbearer spoke Driksys's name, we imagined another way forward. She did not wish harm on innocent Eliksni, only the Fallen fiend: Driksys… and so this House granted shimmer-cloak to conceal, and passage to find her prey.\n\nHLS: Old friends traded for information, access, codes. Driksys oversaw new ring, made for Cabal battle-trials. Challengers from across the Reef fought to lead the Shore's Cabal. The Lightbearer withheld her rage and made her way beneath the stands. To the overlook, where Driksys watched a champion preparing for challengers… in the ring below.\n\nHLS: Trihn, the Lightbearer, drew blades of Ethraaks and burst into the overlook. To confront Driksys, her heart full with vengeance, her mind set on war. But he was not alone. An emissary of the new empress had come to see the challenges. Receiving this emissary, Cabal Blood Guard. The Lightbearer charged Driksys, and a savage battle ensued.\n\nHLS: She was thrown from the overlook, into the ring of challengers… before a great Cabal Gladiator who spoke to her. The Lightbearer, unbeknownst to her, had issued a challenge by entering his ring. If she did not fight, all Cabal would descend upon her. Her victory must be earned with strength and blade alone. No other weapons. No other powers. A proving she accepted to again clear a path to her prey.\n\nHLS: The Gladiator bellowed laughter at the small Awoken Lightbearer. Their blades met, and over many clashes her speed proved superior to the Cabal's might. The blades of Ethraaks are strong—sliced through Cabal armor, left blood and oil in their wake.\n\nHLS: She had found victory, but as her Ghost tended to her wounds, Driksys-coward fled to safety through transmat. Though, all was not lost. The Lightbearer's battle had drawn eyes of the emissary, who lavished praise on her for her prowess, and issued an invitation to speak with Cabal Empress herself. When the Lightbearer returns to us, the House of Light will be ready to assist her in hunting Driksys again.","icon":null}},"2671565007":{"hash":2671565007,"index":1685,"redacted":false,"name":null,"iconImagePath":null,"colorImagePath":null,"displayProperties":{"name":"Pyrrhic Ascent Plate","description":"SIMULATION RECONSTRUCTION LOG // LA-02-02 // TRIALS ARENA, THE LIGHTHOUSE, MERCURY\n\nReed-7's arms feel like they're going to break apart at the seams.  The vibration building in his body threatens to shake him to pieces for every second that he maintains his barrier. It stands as an extension of his Light and also his body. He feels it like a piece of himself, one that he has overextended time and again, as it deflects an Auto Rifle's rapid-fire barrage. \n\nOnly two Guardians are left on the opposing team; the remains of the third are scattered around the area, smoking and sizzling. Reed considers how fast he and Aisha might be able to rush in on their cornered Guardian. Even if Reed gets taken down, it might be enough time for Aisha and Shayura—wherever she is—to secure a victory. \n\n\"Aisha?\" Reed asks. His voice rises in concern as his barrier begins to destabilize. He knows it's now or never. But as he looks to Aisha, Reed spies flames forming between her knuckles. \n\nAisha has the better plan. \n\nAs the opposing Guardian pauses to reload behind cover, Aisha boosts straight into the air, through the top of the barrier. Reed lets the dome collapse and feels the immediate release of pressure on his limbs, his legs nearly buckling. He watches Aisha glow brightly, spinning like a burning wheel before unleashing a volley of knives made from condensed plasma in every direction. \n\nTo Reed, it simply looks like a flash of fire and smoke as the opposing Guardian collapses in a heap, Aisha landing next to him. With a sigh of relief, Reed-7 gives her as enthusiastic a thumbs-up as he can muster. \n\n\"Did you see Shay while you were up there?\" Reed asks. \n\n\"No. She's probably playing tag with the one that keeps going invisible,\" Aisha replies. \"Let's go find her and finish this up.\" \n\nA plume of atomic fire rises up over a nearby block of Vex design as if in direct response to Aisha. The Lighthouse emits a soft tone; the nearby Ghosts begin reconstructing their dead Guardians after the match's conclusion. \n\nA scream rises from the same direction as the fire, spurring Aisha and Reed into action. The pair navigate the familiar Vex architecture quickly. Two more agonized screams fill the air. When they reach the source of the noise, Reed freezes in his tracks as he witnesses Shayura impale the other Guardian through the faceplate of his helmet with her Sword. The opponent's Ghost shrieks in frustration, trying desperately to get between Shayura and his Guardian. \n\nAisha is saying something, but all Reed hears is blood rushing in his ears. Not his blood though. The memory of it. Of something buried behind layered plates of carbon-polymer and plasteel weave. Something haunting his synaptic network. In that moment, Reed is outside of his own body, remembering faces frozen in stone, recalling the whispered plea of his Ghost's tortured voice on Io. \n\n|| Don't you see? || \n\n Reed's heart races. \n\n|| In Light, there is only weakness. || \n\nThe opposing team's Guardian is brought back to life by his Ghost, but before the Guardian can finish shouting a plea to Shayura, the Warlock cuts off his arm in one stroke. She cleaves her Sword through the top of his helmet in a brutal follow-through. Reed feels his chest tightening, feels a sense of panic kicking in. \n\n|| Only failure. || \n\n\"Shay, no!\" Aisha yells, running up to her friend. She wraps her arms around Shayura's midsection. Shayura screams like a frightened animal, lashing out with a swift slash of her Sword in the direction of the Guardian's corpse. \n\n|| Only death. || \n\n\"Shayura! The match is over!\" Reed shouts, snapping back to reality. \"The match is over!\" \n\nIt takes both Reed and Aisha to restrain the enraged Warlock. Shayura's voice cracks in a feral cry as flames race down her arms and swirl along the length of her blood-slicked Sword. \n\n\"No! No! Stop! No!\" Shayura howls, fighting against her comrades. Aisha grabs at Shayura's wrist, keeping her from swinging her Sword again as the freshly resurrected Guardian scrambles away. \n\n\"Shay,\" Aisha pleads, trying to get through to her. \"Shay!\" \n\nShayura screams an endless wail into the scalding Mercurian sky.","icon":null}},"2707363648":{"hash":2707363648,"index":1742,"redacted":false,"name":null,"iconImagePath":null,"colorImagePath":null,"displayProperties":{"name":"V: Watercloth","description":"A few members of his group return and find him half-frozen to the ice, his limbs flexing in delirium as he calls for Yriks.

Forever remembering giving that long-ago order: Burn it. Burn it. Burn it.\n\nThe Guardian nears.\n\nNamrask melts a puddle with his armor's radiators.

Carefully, he chisels open the warp with a third hand; moving too quickly will snap the eggthread.\n\nHis life depends on this. His fourth hand swiftly passes the shuttle through the warp, drawing the first weft across. The thread does not snap; he has woven.\n\n\"Watch me,\" he tells the Drekhs. \"When Eramis is done conquering our enemies, we must know how to make things.\"\n\nThey sit and watch. Their lower arms, half-grown after docking, mimic his motions. Their names are Eoriks, Oeriks, and Yriks: brother, brother, and sister.\n\nWhen it is done, he gives them the little scrap of eggcloth. They murmur in wonder and rub their cheeks against it. \"Bring that to the camp Captain,\" he tells them. \"Tell them that Namrask can weave if he is fed and given fiber.\"\n\nIt is the first time he has ever made anything without ruining it on the loom.","icon":"/common/destiny2_content/icons/3a9a3c8279f6988746af219e3c8d203e.png"}},"2707363654":{"hash":2707363654,"index":1740,"redacted":false,"name":null,"iconImagePath":null,"colorImagePath":null,"displayProperties":{"name":"III: Bannercloth","description":"Europa is colder than the void because the ice steals heat faster than raw vacuum.

She puts the weapon down between them, a sign of truce, and makes the ireliis bow of respect. \"You have the size of an old fighter. Why not come forward?\"\n\nHe is afraid his voice will fail. It comes out strong, but like another's voice: \"I saw what happened the last time Eliksni reached for new power. And the time before that, and the time before that. I will not be part of it.\"\n\nShrugging, Phylaks takes up her pistol and walks away. \"There are many others who will take your place.\"\n\nLater, Yriks tries to change his mind, but Namrask refuses again. \"Eramis derives authority from her ability to grant this power. She cannot give it to everyone; if she does, her authority is lost,\" he says. \"Has she destroyed Servitors?\"\n\n\"I think so,\" Yriks says quietly. \"Drekhtalk says that she broke a Servitor during a ritual to give power. To show that the old ways are done.\"\n\n\"Of course.\" \n\nWill society always be based on violence? Where the basic worker is not the weaver, the farmer, or the healer, but the Drekh: one pistol, one knife, one unit of labor. Employed to steal what it can—the value of a Drekh life.\n\nAnd Namrask helped make that law.\n\nHe rumbles. \"She preaches salvation, but she cannot save everyone. She keeps Ether scarce. More than we can get alone, but not as much as we need. It is the way to rule.\"\n\n\"You have a mind for strategy,\" Yriks observes slyly. \"Who were you before you became our empty weaver?\"\n\n\"Do you know hollowhot's secret?\" he asks and abruptly places some on the ground for a chattering little hatchling to play gathering-games without freezing to the ice. \"Why it is so valuable as insulation?\"\n\n\"What is hollowhot's secret, Namrask? Why is it so valuable?\" She mocks him. \n\nNamrask shows her one thread of the stuff, end-on, so she can see the little bubbles of vacuum that fill the center.\n\n\"There is nothing inside it,\" he says. \"But if you pry too hard, you break the nothing.

And I will not make you lie.\"\n\n\"You do not want to be who you were before,\" Misraaks guesses. \"Would you learn a new trade?\"\n\n\"I would like to weave,\" Namrask says. \"I am not good at it yet.

But the goal is the same: to nurture life with art, and nurture art with your life.\"\n\n\"I distrust Splicers,\" Namrask grunts and rubs his chest. What would a Splicer do to him?

After Chelchis fell, I sent ships to follow the Great Machine. I abandoned all those Houses that could not make war. I ordered my fleet to hunt the Machine. Many rallied after us.

But I doubt the Saint ever knew them by name.\"\n\n***\n\nNamrask settles in the area of the Last City that has been given to the Eliksni. By day, he shares a loom with others. By night, he whispers the names of those he has lost until he falls asleep.\n\nHe sleeps well until the day a Human shouts at him: \"Baby eater!\"\n\nNamrask turns away. But he wants to shout back. About the closed air, closed life of a spacecraft. About the hatchlings who survived and the hard decisions about those who did not. He wished now they had been depraved enough to think of devouring Human young.\n\nBut he sees the young Eliksni, like Eido. He wants to wail at their promise, at their hope. Eido dislikes and avoids him, which is for the best.\n\nEventually, Namrask learns to weave for the Humans. His favorite task is making felt, but he also learns to work in silk. He likes the silkmaker, and runs it manually sometimes, pulling the thread from the spinneret with one hand and then another, maintaining the steady, even tension, which makes the best fabric.\n\nHe wishes that he could weave in Light, like the Guardian Warlocks, who make fieldweave in a secret way. Maybe Misraaks will learn how to do that.\n\nOne day, a machine comes to his market stall. He combs at his shell nervously. The machine-Humans are called \"Exos.\" They remind him of the Vex; it is easier to look at their armored shapes than the unsettling softness of the Humans and two-souled Awoken. This Exo wears a colorful mantle.\n\n\"I recognize you,\" the machine says.\n\nHe quails. \"Namrask sells fabrics,\" he croaks, pretending not to understand.\n\n\"Namrask.\" She laughs quietly. \"I am old, empty weaver. Almost as old as you, I think. But unlike most of my kind, I remember London—and you.\"\n\nHe holds a bolt of fabric between them. She catches two of his hands: her machine flesh is warmer than his.\n\n\"Timelines are born from each moment—we live on one thread woven into a vast tapestry. But what has happened between us, on this thread, is fixed. You cannot run from it. You are a butcher. You and I are still at war,\" she rasps.\n\nShe releases his hands. He stares at her, breathing hard. Ether smokes from his mouth.\n\nShe playfully taps on all four of his hands. \"I am named for an ancient goddess,\" she says, \"with as many arms as you. In her hands are dharma, kama, artha, and moksha. Law, desire, meaning, and finally, liberation. Freedom from the war of death and rebirth. Are you freed by your rebirth as Namrask?\"\n\nHe repeats, \"Namrask sells fabrics.\"\n\n\"Maybe.\" There is laughter in her voice. \"But I do not think moksha has granted you true rebirth.\"\n\n\"I have not forgotten what you did when you were Akileuks. And I never will,\" she says quietly.\n\nHe stole that name, like any other plunder, and used it.

Refracted light from the aura of the Traveler scattered shadows on the street in unusual ways, but no one was paying attention to the shadows today. Neighbors across the street in brownstones watched movers carry furniture out of the building.\n\nThe whirr-clack of two decommissioned Generation-1 Redjacks carrying an antique chaise lounge echoed down the street. The machine noise was met with the laughter of children pursuing them in amused delight. These Redjacks no longer wore the Vanguard insignia. Instead, they displayed a serial number and the logo for a long-term storage company.\n\n\"C'mon, kids, stay out of their way,\" warned a tall, broad-shouldered woman in a worker's jumpsuit. She wore the same logo as the Redjacks, the name Sonja embroidered on one sleeve. \n\n\"How are we doing in there?\" she called into the foyer.\n\n\"Two more chairs, the armoire, and then we gotta call the Forces of the City about all the munitions,\" answered another mover inside the building.\n\nSonja sighed, fixed the two children with a warning look, and walked up the steps into the foyer of the building. Inside, she found her coworker—Maron—cataloging items in a datapad while two more decommissioned Gen-1 Redjacks idled nearby.\n\nThe munitions Maron had mentioned were significant. Boxes of ammunition piled chest high, ferroplastic cases, stacks of loose body armor, and one large Sword partly wrapped in sturdy cloth bound in buckled straps.\n\n\"This was all in her apartment?\" Sonja asked in disbelief. \n\nMaron just shook his head in response. \"Wild, isn't it? Like an armory in there.\"\n\n\"Are next of kin picking this up?\" Sonja wondered.\n\n\"She didn't have any,\" was Maron's somber response. He handed over his datapad to her, and she reviewed the checklist.\n\n\"So, what's happening to all of this? Why is it moving?\" Sonja asked as she scanned the list.\n\nMaron sighed with a shrug. \"Building owner needs the apartment vacated. There's people moving away from the neighborhoods around the, uh, Eliksni Quarter, and he wants to clean the unit up for sale. People like stuff like that—historic.\" Maron made a sweeping gesture with one hand as if motioning to a marquee overhead. \"A Guardian lived here.\"\n\nSonja looked up from the datapad with a crease in her brow. \"A literal war hero dies fighting for us, and some landlord wants to monetize her space?\"\n\n\"The hell are you yelling at me for?\" Maron complained as he turned to the Redjacks, giving them instructions on what to carry next. \"If she lived up in the Tower, I'm sure they'd have turned it into a shrine. But she didn't, and they won't.\"\n\nHe didn't wait for a response and followed the Redjacks as they carried an armoire out onto the street.\n\nSonja, left with her thoughts, looked down at the datapad again. She brushed her thumb over an item, swiped left and then down.\n\n[DELETE ITEM?]\n\nSonja clicked the green check mark. She knew where at least one item belonged, and it wasn't in a storage locker. They could fire her later. Or maybe, she'd just quit.\n\nSloane would have liked that.","icon":null}},"2809967986":{"hash":2809967986,"index":1767,"redacted":true,"name":null,"iconImagePath":null,"colorImagePath":null,"displayProperties":{"name":"Classified","description":"Keep it secret.

They were still well within the standard deviation. \"I'm surprised to hear you say that, Osiris.

You understand that history is changeable… but also inevitable.\" \n\n\"I used to be certain of that,\" he agreed. \"But now I have to wonder, if history is inevitable, why am I constantly surprised?\" \n\nLakshmi chuckled. She had heard his comment before, of course, but her premonition had not adequately conveyed his fatuousness. \n\n\"And what do you think, Osiris?

Even those who came armed expected to fight the Fallen, not a Guardian. \n\nThe Hunter called out in a half-whisper: \"I don't want any trouble.\" \n\nThe woman stood frozen as the young man beside her moved toward the Hunter, his jaw set. \"No!\" his companion hissed. \"Are you crazy?\" She grabbed his arm to haul him behind the ruined Ether tank, but he wrenched free. \n\nThe young man stepped slowly toward the Hunter. \"You're on the wrong side of this thing,\" he started. \n\nThe Hunter pulled back on his Hand Cannon's hammer with an audible click. \n\n\"I don't think I am,\" he replied. \n\nUnwilling to test the Hunter's mettle, the young man called over his shoulder. \"Let's go.\" \n\nThe Hunter narrowed his eyes. He watched as the young man slinked past him and spat at his feet. Something old and terrible rose up inside of the Hunter; it took all of his focus to steady his hand. \n\nThe conspirators peeled away from their hiding places, one by one, disappearing into the dark. Some hissed choice insults and dispersions at the Hunter under their breath, though none dared to look at him. \n\nIn just a few minutes, the block was deserted except for the Hunter, who stood alone in the street until his Ghost complied over his shoulder. \n\nIt chirped with concern. \"You wouldn't really have shot them, right?\" \n\nThe Hunter hesitated as he holstered his weapon. \"They needed to know I was serious, Glint.\" \n\n\"But you weren't,\" his Ghost insisted. Wordlessly, the Hunter began making his way through the destruction. Someone would sound the alarm soon—he didn't want to be there when they did. \n\n\"Tell me you weren't serious,\" his Ghost said again, lagging behind, \"…were you?\"","icon":"/common/destiny2_content/icons/c064d2f3caf0de9fd617b2a16d9ff70d.png"}},"2920704745":{"hash":2920704745,"index":1731,"redacted":false,"name":null,"iconImagePath":null,"colorImagePath":null,"displayProperties":{"name":"IV - Conspirators","description":"Arach Jalaal narrowed his eyes with impatience as Dead Orbit's head of logistics struggled to satisfactorily account for the faction's supply caches. The pair had been wandering around the massive Hangar for an hour while an enormous ship was being loaded in the background.\n\nJalaal had seen the celestial disappearances and the encroachment of the Black Fleet as clear signs that Dead Orbit's final exodus must soon begin. He had ordered a redoubling of departure preparations, but found the faction's rank-and-file struggling to keep pace. \n\nJalaal cut off his subordinate's bumbling presentation. \"This is insufficient. Earth will soon be behind us, and Dead Orbit will have to survive on the supplies that we provide.\" His mild tone and half-lidded gaze underscored the gravity of his words. \"Supplies that you are in charge of tracking. You do understand that, don't you?\" \n\nA furious blush spread across the administrator's face. He bowed his head and scuttled away as Jalaal crooked his head in annoyance. \n\nBehind him, a raspy voice floated up from the maze of towering crates: \"Leaving us so soon, Jalaal?\" \n\nHe turned to find Lakshmi-2 and Executor Hideo. The Future War Cult leader stood formally, hands clasped before her, while the head of New Monarchy browsed the shipping crates with casual interest. \n\n\"This is an impressive collection. I had no idea Dead Orbit was so well funded.\" Hideo gestured broadly to the crates. \n\nJalaal shrugged. \"It's a life's work, Hideo. Everything we'll need to re-seed the Human species elsewhere. You should join us.\" \n\n\"We're fine where we are, thank you,\" Lakshmi interjected. \"As a matter of fact, that's why we've come.\" \n\nJalaal bowed his head and gestured toward the Hangar exit. The trio ambled outside. \n\n\"Hideo and I are concerned about the current Vanguard leadership,\" Lakshmi began carefully. \n\nJalaal allowed himself a mirthless chuckle. \"Yes, I've heard your open editorials. You're becoming quite the demagogue. I never knew you held such strong feelings about the Fallen.\"  \n\n\"If it's incitement to speak the truth, then so be it,\" Lakshmi fired back, sharper than intended. \"The Fallen have been a useful catalyst, but that doesn't mean we are wrong.\" \n\n\"Perhaps not about the Vanguard,\" Jalaal replied, \"but the Cult is hemorrhaging members. And I doubt it's your best and brightest remaining.\" \n\n\"Those who wish to leave are free to do so,\" Lakshmi said with a pointed glance toward the Dead Orbit ship. \"We'll be stronger without them.\" \n\n\"Zavala and Ikora have been ineffective since the Speaker died,\" Executor Hideo cut in. \"The disappearance of the planets caught them unprepared. They're allowing Guardians to use the Darkness. And now they've cut a deal with the Cabal?  It's just too much.\" \n\n\"We must have leadership whose point of view is more closely aligned to that of the people,\" Lakshmi said. \n\n\"And who do you propose, exactly?\" Jalaal stopped the trio at the corner of a broad thoroughfare, where the rumble of cargo movers masked their conversation. \n\n\"Saladin was our first choice,\" Hideo added with an ill-concealed smirk, \"but he's not as cutthroat as he seems. Appears the Iron Lord has a soft spot for Commander Zavala.\" \n\nLakshmi gave Hideo a look, as though he had revealed too much. \"We are now considering Saint-14,\" she said, pointedly bringing the conversation back to the present. \n\nJalaal raised an eyebrow. \"Who else is committed to your little coup?\"  \n\n\"We have somebody in a position of influence. Someone who can ensure an orderly transfer of power,\" Lakshmi answered. \n\n\"That person would have to be very clever indeed,\" Jalaal said gravely. \"For your sake. Ikora Rey is not a target to miss.\"\n\nTh e moment stretched as Jalaal measured the situation. He had long considered what a change of leadership might mean for Dead Orbit; for the resettlement and survival of the Human species. And as always, the allure of personal power—a position of eminence in a dying society—was a constant temptation.","icon":"/common/destiny2_content/icons/c064d2f3caf0de9fd617b2a16d9ff70d.png"}},"2920704746":{"hash":2920704746,"index":1734,"redacted":false,"name":null,"iconImagePath":null,"colorImagePath":null,"displayProperties":{"name":"VII - Ripe","description":"I walk through the City on broken legs.

I twist inwardly with disgust.\n\nWhen they first reached for me, I reached back in acid mockery, and they opened themselves to me in stupid, naked innocence. I was giddy. My fingers raked their minds. I forced my will through them using only words and met no resistance.

It had the air of a church—hushed and reverent, but the air of sanctity was undercut by the intrusion of Vex technology. Wires climbed like vines across the ceiling, and the air was filled with the faint smell of ozone. In the middle of the room, reclining on a seat reminiscent of both throne and operating table, was Lakshmi-2. Her face was obscured by a helmet that connected to the mess of wiring above.\n\nStudious Cultists shuffled about with their heads bowed, glancing suspiciously at Ikora. As the Warlock advanced, a Cultist held up a single finger, commanding both silence and patience. Ikora's eyes narrowed. The Cultist whispered into a small microphone next to the Device. Its subaudible hum had been inconspicuous, but once it powered down, the quiet felt overwhelming to Ikora. \n\nLakshmi sat in repose, presumably orienting herself in the current timeline. \"Leave us,\" she said without opening her eyes. \"We'll resume at 14:25.\" Her subordinates filtered from the room, looking past Ikora as if she were invisible. \n\nLakshmi finally opened her eyes, and fixed them on the Warlock. \"I assume you're here to bargain.\" \n\n\"I'm not.\" Ikora's tone was calm and cold. \"I'm here to issue a warning of my own.\" \n\n\"Warn me?\" Lakshmi laughed, her voice thin. \n\n\"If we have any further incidents on account of your incitement, I will personally find a remote, icy moon to leave you on.\" \n\n Lakshmi tutted. \"Only small minds classify prophecy as provocation.\" She stood up and smoothed her garments. \n\n\"Certainty in the face of the unknown is the provenance of zealots.\" Ikora eyed the Device. \"And the insane. This isn't a debate.\" \n\n\"And yet, you are still here. Come, Ikora, you've not seen what I have.\" Lakshmi gestured to the Device. \"The Botza District under assault for a second time. Saint-14, pinned down by gunfire. And you…\" she trailed off, \"screaming for help over the comms.\" \n\n\"How many of your prophecies have gone unfulfilled, Lakshmi?\" Ikora snapped. \"I wish you could hear yourself; how afraid you sound.\" \n\n\"All those years studying under Osiris, and you're still so naïve,\" Lakshmi replied. \n\nIkora's anger flared. She advanced on the Cult leader. \"Cut the B.S., or suffer the consequences. Understand?\" \n\nUndaunted, Lakshmi's artificial eyes shone bright. \"Understood.\" \n\nIkora stepped back and let her anger pass out of her with a sigh. \"Then we're done here.\" She turned on her heels and strode out. \n\nAs she left, Ikora wondered whose prophecy she had just fulfilled—Lakshmi's or her own.","icon":"/common/destiny2_content/icons/c064d2f3caf0de9fd617b2a16d9ff70d.png"}},"2920704748":{"hash":2920704748,"index":1728,"redacted":false,"name":null,"iconImagePath":null,"colorImagePath":null,"displayProperties":{"name":"I - ACCEPTANCE","description":"\"I'm the most qualified for this!\"\n\nCrow's voice reverberated off of the immense window, making the Vanguard Commander's office feel even more cavernous than it was.

Crow sighed and paced in the gloom like a caged animal.\n\nZavala faced the window and stood, unmoving; a statue carved of larimar, depicting a test of infinite patience. He glanced over at Ikora, her hands gently clasped as she watched Crow with disquieted contemplation. \n\n\"We know,\" she said, after what felt like an eternity, \"but your expertise and relationship with the Eliksni aren't the only deciding factors here.\"\n\n\"Exactly how long am I going to be continually tried in a court of public opinion?\" Crow asked pointedly. \"And when in this trial will I be given a clear understanding of what I'm on trial for?\"\n\nZavala regarded the Awoken's reflection in the window; it reminded him of the near-fatal walk through the gardens not all that long ago. His shoulders sagged.\n\n\"Crow,\" Zavala said as he turned to face him. \"This is a delicate situation. The Consensus has come down hard on us for welcoming the Eliksni into the City, and I can't have them using you as another bludgeon.\"\n\n\"So that's all this is: a political maneuver,\" Crow pushed. \"To protect yourselves. No hard feelings? Nothing behind the looks you give me when you don't think I'm watching?\" Zavala stiffened, and Crow sensed the conversational temperature in the room change. \n\n\"This matter aside, if your past identity became public before we have a plan in place, it could cause considerable harm to you and to the people you care about,\" Ikora said evenly. \"People who have come to care about you,\" she added.\n\nFor a long time, no one spoke—and when Crow did, his voice was small. \"Then what? I keep hiding from the shadow of the man I was before? Forever?\"\n\n\"Not forever,\" Ikora said firmly, \"but for now.\"\n\nCrow shifted his focus to Ikora and saw the hurt in her eyes. He'd seen it in Amanda's, too, whenever she spoke of the dead.\n\nWithout another word, he nodded and left.\n\nIkora closed her eyes, and the breath she'd been holding slowly left her. \"He's going to Osiris,\" she warned.\n\n\"And if Osiris is half the leader he's shown himself to be, he'll tell him the same thing,\" Zavala said with great fatigue, finally sinking into his chair.

Amanda Holliday scanned the crate into her datapad, the unexpected shipment of emergency supplies from the Tangled Shore nearly offloaded.\n\n\"Don't be such a sourpuss,\" she said lightly. \"Mixing with new folk's good for the soul.\"\n\n\"I mix!\" objected Saint. \"But the Fallen… they do not enjoy my company. And I feel the same for them.\"\n\n\"Maybe that's exactly why Ikora picked you for this,\" Amanda said.\n\nThough Saint was fully helmeted, she could swear he rolled his eyes.\n\nTwo more Eliksni came bearing another crate. One noticed Saint too late and stumbled, dropping the crate—its security locks popped as it crashed to the ground. A young Eliksni wearing House of Light colors and a bright orange and blue Vanguard lanyard scampered over in distress.\n\nSaint sighed. \"It is fine,\" he said to the Eliksni. \"Spider probably sends more surplus from old House of Dusk. Knowing you carry supplies from our enemies is great joke to him.\" He dragged the crate out of the walkway with one hand and knelt to repair the locks.\n\nAs Amanda scanned the damaged crate, the young Eliksni came closer. He eyed Saint warily, then held up a sheaf of paper like a shield. \"Manifest,\" he stated haltingly. \n\n\"Thank you,\" Amanda said with unforced brightness. She tapped her datapad. \"I've got it digitally.\"\n\n\"You got it digitally,\" echoed the Eliksni. He fidgeted for a moment, then proudly held up the badge on his lanyard, which read TEMPORARY.\n\nAmanda smiled. \"What've you got there?\"\n\n\"Authorization for unloading of supplies from Tangled Shore. Of supplies sent from Spider,\" he said. He leaned in slowly, looking carefully at Saint and Amanda. \n\n\"My gentlemen,\" he added slyly.\n\nAmanda snorted so abruptly that Saint fumbled with a lock, crushing it in his hand.\n\nSaint looked up. \"Can you two not be quiet?\"\n\n\"C'mon now,\" Amanda admonished Saint lightly. \"I don't hear you practicin' your Eliksni, and this fella's doing his best to bridge the gap.\" \n\nAmanda turned back to the Eliksni. \"That ain't exactly right, but you speak our language pretty well,\" she said.\n\n\"Thank you,\" answered the Eliksni, clearly eager for conversation. \"Do all Humans here serve Spiderkell?\"\n\n\"Serve Spider?\" Amanda spat. \"Spider's nothing but a—\" and the five spirited words that followed were replete with hard consonants. \n\nThe Eliksni froze, wary of her tone while not understanding her words.\n\nAmanda caught herself and took a breath. \"…which is our way of saying he's a kind and generous individual,\" she said to the Eliksni, who nodded along with her.\n\n\"This lock has been ruined by distractions,\" Saint said as he rose to his feet. He removed the lid and looked inside, then lifted a loose coil of rubbery tubes. \n\n\"Servitor plugs, filters, Ether circulators…\" The Titan made a confused noise.\n\n\"Something wrong?\" Amanda asked.\n\n\"Not at all,\" mumbled Saint as he picked up a small golden cylinder trailing braided sapphire cords. \"This rebreather alone is worth more than my ship.\" \n\nAmanda moved toward Saint and looked for herself. She recognized a few necessary survival items—condensed prefab ceramic plating, vapor distillers, generator couplings—but amongst the tubes and filters were otherworldly treasures: A nanomesh sphere filled with thick pink liquid. A chrome conduit splitter with entropic plating. A glimmering opal sparkling in a nest of delicate lavender sponges. \n\n\"The hell is Spider playing at?\" Amanda said to herself. She called out to the Eliksni: \"Are they all like this?\" \n\n\"Yes. Each one is very full. Full of delights, from our culture. From our home. We are very thanks.\" He cocked his head and clicked. \"Thankful?\"\n\nAmanda nodded. \"Let me see that manifest,\" she said, taking the papers from the Eliksni. He nodded and rejoined the other workers.\n\n\"They will still need many of our resources to stay here,\" Saint said as he carefully resealed the crate, \"but this will make things easier. I am surprised Spider is so generous, even to his own people.\"\n\nAmanda frowned at the manifest. \"This doesn't make sense,\" she said. \"There's a note at the top: 'Don't know what half this stuff is, but it's got to be good if Spider had it.' It's all written by hand, and there aren't values for anything on here.\"\n\nSaint looked at the papers over Amanda's shoulder. \"The crates came from Spider's storehouse,\" he said. \"If he did not send them, who did?\"\n\n\"Look at this listing!\" Amanda continued. \"This item says 'best osmosis filters (hidden in his bottom drawer).' This item is just a row of question marks. Here's one listed as 'a clock thing.' This line says 'noisy cube: smells bad but everybody likes it.' And what's with this signature?\"\n\nAmanda squinted at the shape scrawled at the bottom of the form. \"It's a… ship?\" she guessed, handing the paper to Saint.\n\nThe Titan turned his head as he looked at the drawing. \"Aha!\" he cried, slapping the paper with the back of his hand. \"Look, is bird!\"\n\nAmanda looked again at the uneven charcoal lines and could just make out a wobbly black bird.

He lowered his head and rubbed his eyes, trying to collect his thoughts. There were reports from Hunters in the field. Increased Vex activity across the system. Coordinated attacks on Vanguard operations. Anomalous disturbances within the City. All on top of Eliksni and Human confrontations within the City's walls.\n\nA buzzing hum bloomed to life over Zavala's shoulder, followed by the gentle weight of a Ghost that came to settle there. \"Is this the best use of your time?\" Targe wondered aloud, which elicited a look from the corner of Zavala's eye. Targe rarely spoke, but when he did, there was always purpose.\n\n\"I don't recall asking for your opinion,\" Zavala said as he tried to refocus.\n\n\"I don't recall giving one.\"\n\nZavala turned this time to give Targe another look.\n\n\"You two can't keep doing the work of three people,\" Targe insisted. \"Talk to Ana again.\"\n\nZavala leaned back in his chair. \"Targe, there is no way I am going to convince—\" \n\nAn alert chimed at the command console to his right.\n\n\"Incoming call from Empress Caiatl,\" Targe said wearily. \"Let it go to depot.\"\n\nZavala stubbornly rose from his chair. \"No,\" he said, receiving the call. Caiatl's imperial seal appeared on the screen with a notice: AUDIO ONLY.\n\n\"Empress Caiatl, to what do I owe the pleasure?\" Zavala asked, tiredly scratching a hand over his stubble. Targe watched for a moment before he dematerialized. \n\n\"Commander,\" Caiatl greeted, her voice swelling to fill the room as if she were standing there. \"The fleet's long-range sensors detected a growing anomaly located in the vicinity of the Last City.\"\n\n\"Why the sudden concern?\"\n\nCaiatl snorted. \"I bear no concern, Commander. But if the Vanguard were suddenly annihilated, it would behoove me to at least be aware.\"\n\n\"Of course,\" Zavala said softly. \"Well, we're still here.\"\n\n\"For now.\"\n\nThe leading edge in her tone hooked him. \"Why are you really calling?\" \n\nThere was no response from the other side for a few moments. When Caiatl spoke next, her tone was as measured as before, but lacked any performative airs. \"Lakshmi-2's latest broadcast to the City reached our fleet,\" she said. \"You are truly a proud hawk standing in a nest of vipers, aren't you?\"\n\n\"Lakshmi is a politician.\" \n\n\"Words are the most dangerous of weapons, Commander,\" Caiatl reminded him. \"It begins as whispering convictions, then full-voiced dissent, and the next thing you know, you will wake with a knife driven into your chest.\"\n\n\"Spoken from experience,\" Zavala jabbed back.\n\n\"Spoken from experience,\" Caiatl doubled down, unashamed. \"Lakshmi is undermining the Vanguard's authority by diminishing your role in the eyes of the people. Spoken loudly enough and often enough, her words may begin to make sense even to those who are not of the same mind.\"\n\nZavala sighed, and Caiatl felt its weight all the way across the system.\n\n\"I trust you to honor the terms of our armistice. I do not trust whomever your successor might be,\" Caiatl warned.\n\nZavala weighed anger and intrigue against one another, finding the scales a useless tool in arbitrating his response to the situation. He stepped back to the console and did as Cayde might say: just wing it.\n\n\"This is not the first threat to my authority I've weathered,\" Zavala said, his voice rising. \"So don't delude yourself into thinking otherwise. And don't you dare come at me for whatever remorse you might be feeling about deposing your father.\"\n\nZavala heard the low rumble of an appreciative vocalization over the speakers. \"I do not feel remorse because Calus was my father,\" Caiatl explained, her tone softening. \"I feel remorse because of what Ghaul did to my people. We opened the door for the Hive, handed Xivu Arath a knife, and were surprised when we felt the kiss of steel in our spine.\"\n\nI hate to see a warrior I admire and respect do the same with a less worthy adversary. But perhaps you are not in need of such unsolicited counsel.\"\n\nZavala looked up, out to the lightless city beyond, and closed his eyes. \"And what counsel is that?\"\n\nWhat Caiatl said next was not in the voice of an empress, but a friend: \"Umun'arath was my most trusted counselor.

Now, striding across the elevated catwalk, her temper nearly lifted her off the ground in righteous fury. \n\nSuddenly a deep, familiar voice broke through the tumult: \"Anger bends the mind, as gravity bends space-time. It's a form of distortion—useful, but dangerous.\" Ikora turned, half expecting to find Osiris standing behind her.

She closed her eyes and listened to her breath. Concentrated on slowing her heartrate.

Saint put down his datapad next to a crate of grenades and stood up. Osiris scanned the shelves of guns and ammo, looking for something. \n\nSaint stood dumbly, waiting for some kind of acknowledgement. When it was clear that none was forthcoming, he called out, \"Osiris. What are you looking for?\" His voice was loud and strained. \n\nOsiris didn't turn from the shelves. \"The Light suppressor that the Psions used on Zavala's Ghost. I need it for my research.\" \n\n\"Zavala kept it, I think. Ask him about it,\" Saint replied, trying not to sound put out. \n\nOsiris faced his partner, his eyes narrowed in thought. \"Very well.\" Then, as an afterthought, \"Thank you.\" \n\nAs the former Warlock turned to leave, Saint called out, \"I was hoping we could spend some time together soon. Just the two of us.\" \n\n\"Doing what?\" Osiris inquired with a small smile. \n\n\"We could fly out to the Alps,\" Saint suggested. \"Or walk around the ruins of Prague. Like we used to.\" \n\n\"That seems fine,\" Osiris said. He shrugged a shoulder. \"Provided the City doesn't burn to the ground in our absence.\" Then after a beat: \"Is that all?\" \n\nIs that all? Behind his helmet, Saint frowned. \"I suppose.\" \n\nOsiris strode from the room, leaving Saint alone with a sinking feeling in the pit of his stomach. \n\nIII. \n\nLakshmi-2 watched Osiris from across the bustling courtyard. Of all the political creatures in the Tower, he was the one that troubled her most. \n\nHer concern was not a matter of the ex-Warlock's unpredictability. In fact, it was just the opposite. \n\nThe Device had no trouble parsing his arrogant brilliance—his every move was well within the standard deviation. \n\nYet for someone with a legendary reputation as an eccentric, his every move as of late had been shockingly moderate. It was his newfound predictability that bothered her. \n\nPerhaps the loss of his Ghost had affected him more than anyone understood. Maybe the burden of mortality had sapped his courage. \n\nIt was also possible that Osiris represented a blind spot in the Vex dataset; something that only a Human could comprehend.

Like much of the Cabal Empire's ancient history, many dates and facts were altered to cast a favorable light upon the former emperor and his rise to power. Most of the Cryptarchy's information comes from post-Calus records, scoured from archival remnants on Red Legion vessels and forays into the Leviathan. As such, this record's historic context must be marked with an asterisk for questionable accuracy.\n\nAccording to excerpts from the Cabal legal record known as the Codex of Lawful Transgressions, the Hammer of Proving dates back to the Foundation Age of Emperor Calus's reign. During this era, Cabal society was dominated by militaristic ambition centered around conquest and imperial expansion. As Calus took control of the empire, he sought to steer the Cabal people toward a society of art and philosophy (though this degenerated into decadence and debauchery).\n\nIn the early Foundation Age, the Rite of Proving was the primary means by which disputes were settled among free Cabal (much like how the Crucible was formed among the Guardians of the Last City). During the Proving, two Cabal or their appointed representatives would air their grievances in a public forum and one or both Cabal would declare a challenge. These Cabal would battle one another to submission or to the death—often the latter—and the winner would be seen as the right and lawful party in the dispute.\n\nCalus disapproved, but knew that overturning a centuries-old tradition would be an unpopular decision. Instead, the emperor introduced incrementally draconian and byzantine bylaws into the Proving. One of these stated that if a battle ended with a tie or double-submission, an \"impartial\" imperial arbiter would decide the outcome. This arbiter would carry a symbol of Imperial office: a gold-plated hammer etched with strange runes drawn from Calus's own personal occult obsessions. The Hammer of Proving.\n\nWhereas an impartial arbiter was a widely accepted change to the tradition, Calus abused it to push his own agenda. Over time, the Proving arbiter was granted more and more autonomy to settle battles, eventually gaining the right to enter a battle on their own under a number of flimsy justifications such as balancing \"unfair\" matches, ending matches that went \"overly long,\" or punishing a Proving participant who owed a financial debt to the empire.\n\nThe Proving arbiter became such a disruptive force that within a century, the Rite of Proving had fallen out of common usage, as the law and restrictions around the Rite made it an untenable solution. Ultimately, the role of Proving arbiter was retired and the hammer returned to Calus's vaults.\n\nDuring Caiatl's rise to power, she sought to win over those who had been put off by her father's cynical interpretations of Cabal tradition. Her regime reinstated the Rite of Proving as a simple combat challenge without arbiters or other superfluous trappings, and her adherence to custom gained her the steadfast loyalty of many influential warriors and politicians. This small army of dedicated followers is credited with easing her transition to a place of authority where her self-chosen honorific \"empress\" seems reasonable.\n\nIt is unknown how the Red Legion came into possession of the Hammer of Proving, but the weapon carries a significant historic weight to the Cabal people, one that can be leveraged as both an olive branch and—perhaps most fittingly—a bludgeon, depending on the wielder.","icon":null}},"3651414156":{"hash":3651414156,"index":1788,"redacted":true,"name":null,"iconImagePath":null,"colorImagePath":null,"displayProperties":{"name":"Classified","description":"Keep it secret.

A Ghost reduced to little more than a bare sphere of metal, deprived of a shell, hovers in the corner of the cockpit, watching the Warsat track its path across lonely Venus.\n\n\"There are no sanctioned Vanguard operations on Venus at present,\" the Ghost clarifies, pivoting its cold blue eye up to its Guardian. \"Why do you think he's down there?\"\n\nThe Warlock Shayura reclines against her seat, the old leather creaking. Her attention is not on her Ghost, but rather the Human skull sitting in the middle of her command console. Its hollow eye sockets stare back at her.\n\n\"It hardly matters why he's there,\" Shayura indicates listlessly as she examines the skull's cheekbones. Her fingers graze the microfractures—an artifact of Shotgun pellet impact. \"All that matters is we find him.\"\n\nShayura's Ghost looks away from her and focuses on Venus's soft glow in the dark.\n\n\"When will you be returning to Earth?\" he asks.\n\nShayura doesn't vocalize a response, but instead blinks and reorients her glowing-eyed stare on the Ghost. It beeps softly, reconsidering the question.\n\n\"Will you?\" the Ghost still wonders.\n\n\"No,\" Shayura answers flatly. \"There is nothing to go back to. Everyone has either abandoned me or betrayed me. All I have left is the Traveler. And I do not need to be in the City to feel the Light.\" As she says that, Shayura lifts her hand and calls up a rolling curtain of flame from her palm.\n\n\"Praxic Fire guides me,\" Shayura says with the blaze reflecting in her eyes.\n\n//NS66CE_LOG-D// VENUS-IS -IA //\n\n\"You see?

The Eliksni looks the Guardian up and down, then motions to the stark silhouette of a gray concrete-block building rising up from the Venusian overgrowth.\n\n\"This ain't the academy proper,\" the Guardian says on ascent, watching the hazy sky for signs of danger. Moisture clings in glistening beads to his reflective mask; his dark hood shields him from the rest of the elements. \"The hell was this place?\"\n\nThe Eliksni tilts his head to the side, four eyes blinking independently from one another. \"Not Human, don't know. But machine inside.\"\n\n\"Why aren't your people bringing it back? Don't you folks get promotions for finding good salvage or something?\" the Guardian asks, gesturing to the crumbling building.\n\nThe Eliksni once again tilts his head, expression opaque. \"You listen to the Spider's sneak-words too eagerly. Come, we have a long walk to—\" The Eliksni's words are cut off, garbled in a wet scream as he is perforated by a barrage of Submachine Gun fire.\n\nThe Guardian turns, cloak swirling behind him and Hand Cannon at the ready. But it isn't Vex or Fallen descending from the high cliffs—it's a Guardian in black and gold armor gliding to the ground, smoke issuing from the muzzle of her SMG. Shayura's boots lightly touch the leaf-strewn plaza, her eyeless mask fixed on the chrome-clad Hunter.\n\n\"He wasn't a combatant!\" the Hunter shouts.\n\nShayura slowly approaches the Guardian. \"Did you find him within the hem of Eramis's skirt? Or did you swear yourself to the Darkness after her passing?\"\n\nThe Hunter backs away, up the stairs, Hand Cannon trained on Shayura. He recognizes her armor for what it is—a reward of the Trials. \"I know you…\" His voice quavers. \"You shouldn't be here. When did the Vanguard let you out?\"\n\n\"They didn't. I let myself out since they were too busy opening the gates for our enemies,\" Shayura indicates, motioning with the barrel of her SMG to the dead Eliksni. \"But, you know why I'm here .\"\n\n\"I know you're a few rounds short of a full clip,\" the Guardian quips back, making a flippant gesture with his Hand Cannon. In that moment of distraction, Shayura shoots him six times in two short bursts.\n\nThe Guardian collapses, his gun tumbling down the steps. A moment later, his Ghost materializes, shell flared in anger. \"What are you doing?! We—\" \n\nShayura moves like a lightning bolt, materializing beside the Ghost with an upward flourish of a sword of raw Praxic Fire. The Ghost looses a howling scream of horror as he shatters into a flurry of glittering pieces.\n\nCrumpled on the stairs, the Hunter coughs, his throat damp with blood. Shayura pulls her attention away from the shattered Ghost, training her SMG down at her quarry. \"Traitor,\" she says in a shaky, gasping breath fueled by adrenaline.\n\nThe Hunter laughs, gagging on his own blood as he does. \"You're no better than the Dredgen ,\" he says, in pain. Then, even quieter, \"…or Malphur .\"\n\n\"I killed an agent of the Darkness,\" Shayura says, and the Hunter has no rebuttal this time.

They say they can refocus Light \"through the prism of their will.\"\n\nWhile we at the Cryptarchy have nothing but respect for Eliksni culture, we wished to explore the truth behind these claims.\n\nAfter studying one of the few Splicer Gauntlets that fit non-Eliksni hands (graciously created by Mithrax, Kell of the House of Light, for select residents of the Last City), we have determined that the wrist-mounted Gauntlet is little more than a converter that can be used to focus trace amounts of residual Light already present in the environment.\n\nA trained Splicer can use their Gauntlet to interface with any latent data networks in the vicinity. This allows the bearer to access technological mundanities as well as deeper, infinitely more protected networks, including the Vex domain itself.\n\nOnce connected, access to these networks is severely limited for the Eliksni Sacred Splicers, though Guardians, due to their unique relationship with the Light, are able to manifest corporeally within the network for short periods of time. They can then alter the data found therein with focused percussive energy—including gunfire—in a baffling scientific process the Cryptarchy does not yet fully understand.\n\nThe Gauntlet seems capable of powering itself by transmuting unbound energy into Ether. Traditionally, Sacred Splicers would undertake great journeys to charge their Gauntlets with naturally occurring residual energy, but Guardians can use their martial prowess to convert their foes into bountiful energy sources.\n\nIn closing, the Sacred Splicers merely exploit a tool that induces Light to resonate at frequencies approaching that of the Vex Nexus, enabling them to access to certain low-security Vex systems. The Eliksni falsely believe that a deep spiritual connection allows them to bend the Light to their every whim, but this can be ea5ily dismissed as myth—the regre7able bypr0duc7 of ov3r@c71v3|| |  |    |        |\n\nIt is disappointing to hear such condescending generalizations from a species who so recently found themselves in the graces of the Great Machine.

What do you seek, Black Armorer?\"\n\nAda sat on a futon, keeping a healthy distance from the Eliksni. \"I'm searching for information from the BrayTech facilities on Europa.\"\n\n\"And you believe we have this?\"\n\n\"I know some of your people defected from House Salvation. They may have seen something.\"\n\nEido nodded. \"They have seen many things.\"\n\n\"One of my forebearers, a great weaponsmith, worked at the Bray facilities on Europa… but I only know a fraction of what she was doing there.\"\n\n\"Ah,\" Eido said. \"Always about guns.\"\n\nAda frowned. \"Your people are no strangers to weaponsmithing.\"\n\nEido inhaled. \"True. And now, improbably, both our arsenals stand together in the shadow of the Great Machine.\"\n\n\"An alliance that makes it all the more logical for you to help me,\" Ada said.\n\nEido placed her claws together. \"I will not help, because I cannot. No mentions have been made of anything related to your Armory founders.\"\n\nAda's gaze dropped to the floor.\n\nEido cocked her head and observed the Exo. \"Such despair. Maybe this is about more than guns after all?\"\n\nAda paused briefly. \"I lost something. A part of me.\"\n\nEido nodded solemnly. \"Your forges, yes?\" \n\n\"My whole existence was tied to the Armory. To those forges. Without them, I feel…\"\n\n\"Without purpose?\" Eido finished the thought.\n\nAda shook her head. \"This isn't— I'm not sure you could understand.\"\n\nEido chuckled—a guttural grunt combined with clicking teeth. \"Our history is littered with the banners of lost Houses. Most of us have worn more than one color, knelt before Kell after Kell, hoping that they would be the last.\" She leaned closer to Ada. \"Eliksni understand the fluidity of purpose very well.\"\n\n\"Fluidity implies a continuation,\" Ada replied. She sighed heavily. \"But it seems my path is coming to an end.\"\n\nClicks resonated in Eido's jaw. \"Devils was a dead House, until Eramis made it new. Mithrax was Dusk, and now, he is Light. Paths only end when we stop walking.\"\n\nAda studied the Eliksni. \"This is not the conversation I was expecting.\"\n\n\"If this settlement is going to work, it's probably best to break from old expectations,\" Eido said.\n\nAda nodded and looked at the light softly radiating through the window. \"I've taken enough of your time. Thank you,\" she said and confidently extended her arm with sincere gratitude.\n\nA clawed hand landed softly on her shoulder as the Eliksni instead thrust her datapad into Ada's outstretched hand. The befuddled Exo quickly parsed the screen.\n\n\"This is something we found in the Bray archives. It is not what you were looking for, but it may help you decide where to walk next,\" Eido said.\n\n\"I—I'll look into it, I suppose.\"\n\n\"Good,\" Eido replied as Ada stood and slid the datapad under her arm. She hesitated.\n\n\"Are you sure it's a good idea to give me this? How… how will it look to your allies—you helping me like this?\"\n\nEido chittered. \"It will look like unity.\"","icon":"/common/destiny2_content/icons/038b42b9e9b219fda9209ebb81a53df9.png"}},"4012977684":{"hash":4012977684,"index":1763,"redacted":true,"name":null,"iconImagePath":null,"colorImagePath":null,"displayProperties":{"name":"Classified","description":"Keep it secret.

He leaned against an iron railing, watching Guardians and citizens alike moving below, Eliksni with them.\n\nA Dreg approached the memorial and led his child to stand among the mourners. Urged forward by a gentle nudge, the child gingerly placed a gilded eggshell at the memorial's base. Gold soldering sealed a myriad of fractures, making a once broken egg whole again. Mithrax's throat tightened at the sight. It was a memorial for a child. Lost.\n\nThe walkway behind Mithrax groaned as Saint-14 cut a large silhouette against the clear sky. Shoulder to shoulder, they stood. Neither spoke.\n\nThey watched as Ikora and Zavala conversed with departing mourners. The Dreg and his son approached, and with a bittersweet smile, Ikora made certain to introduce them to Zavala. Big, stern, stoic Zavala took to one knee and spoke to the child, eye to eye.\n\n\"I never thought I'd see the day,\" Saint finally said, unable to look away.\n\nMithrax responded, not with words, but with a fluttering purr-like rumble and mirrored Saint's posture.\n\n\"Do you think this will hold? An alliance, fragile like glass, held in a fist?\" Saint asked.\n\n\"Only the Great Machine knows what will come from over the horizon. We must be content with our own limited perspectives,\" Mithrax said with conviction.\n\nSaint nodded. Down below, Amanda Holliday drew their attention as she knelt before the memorial to light a candle. She stood and stepped back, lingering. Mithrax and Saint watched in silence as she rose up on her toes and began scanning through the crowd. As if she were looking for someone.\n\nShe gently pushed through the throng of people and reached out to another mourner in a white cloak. Both recoiled in surprise, Amanda seemingly apologizing to the cloaked woman at some misunderstanding. They exchanged brief words, awkward laughs, sympathies. When Amanda caught sight of Lord Saladin, however, she took her leave and disappeared into the crowd.\n\nMourners parted around the Iron Lord, respectful of his space and reputation as he laid a handful of spent shell casings at the memorial with reverence. The offering's meaning was lost on Mithrax.\n\nWhen Saladin rose from the memorial, he turned and looked up at the pair on the overwatch, his face cast in shades of doubt, remorse, and uncertainty as he quietly departed.\n\n\"I do not know that one,\" Mithrax said with a look to Saint. \"He seems… unhappy.\"\n\nSaint slowly shook his head. \"Lord Saladin,\" he clarified. \"He has lost many. Lost his heart, his hope. Lost so many, he believes he stands alone, even when surrounded by others. I understand his pain. I see…\" Saint thinks on how Osiris would describe it. \"…his cautionary tale.\"\n\nMithrax heard the ache in Saint's voice. \"And how are you?\"\n\nSaint tensed at the question. The railing in his hand creaked as his grip tightened and bent the metal. \"I am fine,\" he lied.\n\n\"Indeed,\" Mithrax said with his best affectation of sarcasm, then placed a hand on Saint's shoulder. \"It is not above a warrior's station to feel pain. Not above a warrior's station to express spirit-wounds.\" Mithrax's grip firmed on Saint's shoulder; reassuring, stabilizing. \"Not above a warrior's station to break.\"\n\nSaint nodded in half-hearted agreement. \"I should go,\" he said in a tone Mithrax didn't quite understand. \"Thank you, Kell of Kells. You are true friend.\"\n\n\"Go well, Saint,\" Mithrax said with concern. \"Find your lost phoenix.\"","icon":"/common/destiny2_content/icons/c064d2f3caf0de9fd617b2a16d9ff70d.png"}},"4255586669":{"hash":4255586669,"index":1710,"redacted":false,"name":null,"iconImagePath":null,"colorImagePath":null,"displayProperties":{"name":"Empty Vessel","description":"Armored boots clang down metal stairs as Lord Saladin descends the catwalks between the central tower. The Bazaar is otherwise quiet, giving him time to contemplate the strategy needed for his impending diplomatic liaison.\n\n\"I demand a place in the decision making for…\" Saladin trails off in thought as he walks. \"I request addition to your council for…\" He grunts, shaking his head. \"Commander, I'm concerned about your inclusion of Future War Cult in…\" A grumble. None of it sounds right.\n\nSaladin pauses to look out over the City, where the streets are hidden behind a shimmering pall of digital fog. He closes his eyes, shakes his head, and takes a moment to compose himself. There are no sounds of fighting here, no gunshots, no screams. Those exist only in his mind.\n\n\"Zavala. I would like to speak to you as a friend,\" Saladin tries again, then opens his eyes to the Traveler with an affirming nod.\n\n\"You'll have to speak a little louder if you'd like the commander to hear you.\"\n\nThe sudden intrusion of a voice not his own wheels Saladin around, catching Osiris uncomfortably close behind him. Saladin's expression shifts from shock to embarrassment concealed behind a mask of frustration. \"It is unbecoming of you to eavesdrop, Warlock.\"\n\n\"Please,\" Osiris dismisses, slowly approaching Saladin. \"Anyone with an ear could hear you mumbling to yourself. I just happened to comment on it.\" He gestures with an open hand, then clasps both behind his back.\n\n\"I have a meeting to attend,\" Saladin insists, turning to make an abrupt exit. Osiris sidesteps, getting between Saladin and the stairs, and elicits an immediate look of challenge from the Iron Lord.\n\nOsiris, mindfully, raises both his hands. \"Please, Lord Saladin. A moment?\"\n\nSaladin crosses his arms over his chest. Impatience shows in a crease of his brow.\n\n\"Now may not be the best time if you're hoping to find an ally in the commander,\" Osiris explains as he places a guiding hand on Saladin's elbow, drawing him away from the main walkway.\n\n\"Commander Zavala is under considerable stress at the moment,\" Osiris continues. \"While you might see your presence as a reinforcing one…\" He raises his brows, glancing sidelong at Saladin. \"You may not be correct in that assertion.\"\n\n\"Stop talking in circles.\" Saladin plants his feet. \"What is it you're getting at?\"\n\n\"When was the last time you—to put it as you did earlier—eavesdropped?\" \n\nSaladin rankles. \"I do not eavesdrop,\" he growls.\n\n\"Then perhaps that is why you do not realize what the overall opinion of your actions are in the eyes of other Guardians.\" Osiris's tone is gentle, apologetic, measured. It conveys an obvious tone: this news is bad, and he hates to be the bearer of bad news.\n\nSaladin is quiet; Osiris sees the lack of outward defiance as a foothold. He digs in.\n\n\"Many without our shared convictions have questioned your leadership decisions during the recent crisis with Empress Caiatl.\" Osiris dips his head in close to Saladin, voice hushed as if to share a secret. \"Others suggest that it was you who ordered the assassination attempt on the commander.\"\n\n\"An Iron Lord would never,\" Saladin says with a quaver in his voice. \"I am not—\"\n\n\"I know,\" Osiris is quick to softly interject. \"But not everyone knows you like I do. They make well-articulated and convincing arguments based off of your very vocal stance against an armistice with the Cabal.\"\n\nClosing his eyes, Saladin draws in a slow and calming breath. The sounds of gunfire, shouts, and screams are louder now than ever before. Or maybe it's the blood pounding in his ears. \"All the more reason for me to set the record straight.\"\n\n\"Is that what you came to the City for? To set a record straight?\" Osiris presses. \"Just a minute ago, it sounded to me like you wished to ask for a place in Zavala's inner circle. How do you think that might look?\"\n\nSaladin looks in the direction of Zavala's office, hands curling into fists. \"Lakshmi-2 is—\"\n\n\"Let me handle Lakshmi,\" Osiris insists, once more reaching out a hand for Saladin's arm. This time, the Iron Lord doesn't pull away. \"Fight the battles you know you can win, Lord Saladin. I know how to handle her. There may come a time when your strength will be needed again, but that time is not now.\"\n\nSaladin looks sharply to Osiris. A rebuttal forms behind his lips, but is never spoken aloud. He lets his head hang.\n\n\"Thank you, Osiris,\" Saladin says with a heavy heart, conviction flagging. \"You are a true friend.\"","icon":null}},"4289226715":{"hash":4289226715,"index":1708,"redacted":false,"name":null,"iconImagePath":null,"colorImagePath":null,"displayProperties":{"name":"Vex Mythoclast","description":"Some legends live forever.
