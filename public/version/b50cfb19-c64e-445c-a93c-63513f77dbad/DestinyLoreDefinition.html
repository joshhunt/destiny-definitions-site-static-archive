From the palace tower, Immaru watched the churn where it met the Darkness, new waves eroding an ancient shore. The flash of muzzle fire was visible from this perch, even if the combatants weren't.\r\n\r\nHe huffed and shuddered, trying to remember how to speak as he watched the Guardians' unprovoked assault into their Ascendant Plane. \"No better than Scorn,\" he growled.\r\n\r\nSavathûn turned from the honey-sweet music only she could hear and stroked her Ghost. \"Ah, child.

But nobody told these jokers apparently.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your anger is understandable.\" The Witch Queen pulled Immaru to her embrace once more, and slowly his shivers of rage calmed. \"Humans fear death, and you were suckled on their teat. But the Hive know death as the Unseen Sister. It is she who welcomes you home to rest… and who allows you egress when you prove able to take it.\"\r\n\r\nImmaru stared out in silence at the distant flashes of battle. \"Sister or not, it's time we push back. We got anything like they got? A Ghost-killer?\"\r\n\r\n\"The Hive uncovered such weapons long ago, but may have found them… distasteful. I suppose we could recover the magics, but surely you and your fellows would see such tactics as an abomination?\"\r\n\r\nImmaru turned back to face the flashes of rifle fire on the distant shore. \"Not anymore.\"","icon":"/common/destiny2_content/icons/139b1f65ff322b288ed0abd2defa7468.png"}},"81505816":{"hash":81505816,"index":1949,"redacted":false,"name":null,"iconImagePath":null,"colorImagePath":null,"displayProperties":{"name":"Pickman","description":"You needn't resent my hesitation. Mine is a prejudice shared by many: evolution's paintbrush cut within the Hive a terrible anatomy rendered to elicit fear; they are loathsome things to look upon, after all. I speak not as some superstitious provincial afraid of the dark, but as a Ghost well-versed in the language of suffering. \r\n\r\nLook at this one: they call him a Knight, this sin putrefying upon a slab. Is it only brute strength that qualifies a knighthood now? I have little compassion for the universe's mockery upon chivalric ideals.\r\n\r\nIn contrast, I call myself a creature of moral strength and sound reasoning, and as such, believe these traits allow me to judge so unforgivingly—but alas, I am also afflicted by a most curious and inquisitive nature. It is why, when my debased fellows departed to find unity with the Hive, I found myself compelled to witness their descent. \r\n\r\nNot to share in it, of course. I doubt we share anything more than a species and the dark urge we all undoubtedly feel.\r\n\r\nYet as I watched them, I could not deceive myself into denying the elegance of pouring the Light in all its multiplex glory into these avatars of terrible intricacy. It is a sinister geometry, but not without its beauty. Gazing on them with an eye unvarnished by niceties, one can see that a fiendish purity of purpose drives them. They spill confidence like a vintner drunk on his own reserves.\r\n\r\nSuch a shame that this purity and confidence was leveled at the unforgivable quintain striking at our great Traveler and unraveling its works.\r\n\r\nI shudder at the ease with which my comrades ignore such basic logic. This is the Hive! Disciples of that unholy church which laid our creator low. They struck for its heart and shattered a roaring conflagration into ten thousand motes flickering in the wind. In their fervor, they… played midwife, of a sort, to Guardians.\r\n\r\nTo Ghosts.\r\n\r\nTo me.\r\n\r\nCause and effect. Legacy. Is this what my fellow Ghosts see? Why it feels… right?

Naturally. He insisted on naming me Krill in our first exchange because he claims I am as small and useless as the weak pests that the Hive evolved from. Cruelty and suspicion are his nature, but it makes for a poor physician. \r\n\r\nStill, poison is a logical, if ignorant, hypothesis for the condition.\r\n\r\nPatients report various symptoms: mood swings, headache, insomnia. Primary symptom remains the growths. I hesitate to call them \"tumors\"—no signs of metastasization. One must be precise in terminology, after all.\r\n\r\n—-\r\n\r\nAfter some clumsy exploratory surgery on my inner workings, Ubartu-ana seems content I am not some Trojan horse. Wouldn't that be ironic? Ghosts sent to reclaim the Hive from death only to wipe them out by dispersing pathogenic specks rather than Light. \r\n\r\nAs I said: ignorant.\r\n\r\n—-\r\n\r\nBiopsied a dozen growths. No clear results. The masses within are primitive, protoplasmic—little more than interstitial fluid and proteolytic amino acids. Primordial soup, as the Humans say. No sign of infection, but curiously, the lining of these \"cysts,\" for lack of a better term, seems to be saturated with immune cells. Further biopsies will be needed.\r\n\r\n—-\r\n\r\nWondrous developments! Biopsy 37 yielded aggressive results. I pierced a cyst to discover not fluid, but life! A winged arthropod attacked me—defending its host, I estimate! Little of its body remained upon destruction, but it seems to be more energy construct than flesh. I plan to take the next specimen alive for vivisection.\r\n\r\n—-\r\n\r\nConfirmed: the winged arthropods, despite their energy structure, also contain Hive cells!

Arrived on scene. Victim is a Thrall. No identity. Cause of death: fractured neck due to blunt force trauma. Traces of Light detected. Nabenki interviewed the primary suspect; Hive prefer talking to their own and don't respond to things—even things that bring them back from the dead.\r\n\r\nOverheard confession. Suspect is Knight identified as Urukthalyn, victim's commander. Reported that when his Ghost detected Light within victim, Urukthalyn executed him for theft. Open and shut case.\r\n\r\nPLD018. 13:44. Three more deaths fitting same pattern: internal artifacts of Light, victims summarily executed. But circumstances raise more questions. Thralls don't partner with Ghosts; should be unable to receive or carry Light. \r\n\r\nNabenki tasked to investigate. Suspects an organized smuggling ring, potential Human or Fallen infiltration.\r\n\r\nPLD018. 14:57. Encountered suspect Thrall; no identification, classified POI-7. Tests confirm traces of Light. Nabenki applied standard Hive interrogation techniques, extracted confession after extended session. POI-7 admitted to \"stealing\" Light, keeping it in urns. Also implicated a superior Acolyte. Doesn't add up.\r\n\r\nPLD018. 19:12. Requested time alone with suspect to establish rapport. Nabenki hesitant; doesn't like being spoken to unbidden but acquiesces. POI-7 admitted to giving false confession to end \"visceral\" Hive interrogation. Claimed complete ignorance to the Light's origins in his system. When asked about unusual activity, reported that his symbiote feels sated without need for bloodshed or tithing.\r\n\r\nPLD018. 19:33. Consulted Nabenki for context regarding tithing. Apparently, Hive function on a system of energetic kickbacks, paid up the ladder, ending with queen. Would've been useful to know earlier. Suspect this network may be impacted by introduction of Light. Nabenki confirmed Light exhibits a \"negative pressure\" within the system. May be pushing trace amounts back through it.\r\n\r\nHave submitted theory to our commander for further investigation.\r\n\r\nPLD019. 06:30.

Not from sleep. Nothing so gentle.\n\nFrom death? No. Not yet. From lost consciousness… for how long? \n\nHe moves to stand. His feet drift without friction. No ground below him. Falling—no, floating. Pine needles sway in a sea of surrounding green haze. Sunrays plunge through the canopy above and wash over him. His head is lost in the arbor row's motion.\n\nIntermittent feeling prickles the skin beneath his tarnished armor. Saladin reflexively attempts to raise his off-hand to summon Isirah. Numbness responds. He must be hit. He cycles breath through his lungs and sorts instinct from reason. He twists to see the wound. Nerves blaze corkscrews through his neck. Panic—no. No need. Pain he could abide. Reality clarifies. \n\nThe Iron Lord hangs from a branch run through his shoulder back to front, 10 centimeters thick. What good was his damn armor? Saladin traces a thick flow of blood down his arm as it breaks into tributaries before reuniting at his fingertips. Droplets pool some 60 meters below, soon to soak into the soil and fade. Beside the pool lay a splintered rocket launcher he'd forged from a reclaimed mortar, dropped when he lost consciousness. Saladin flexes against the axe strapped to his backplate; wood grinds against his load-bearing collarbone. He grimaces as he lifts his head to gaze at the cliff above.\n\nSmoke rises from a burnt crescent impact, blown clean into the cliff's edge; a recent scar left by an artillery shell meant for Saladin's road-cruiser. Raiders, he thinks. An ambush. He connects incident to meaning: someone looking to make an example of a Lord who dared to venture beyond their territory. Radegast had warned him of Risen thugs fleeing to the far wilds to escape the Iron Lords' reach. He had told Saladin of their hostility. Their lawlessness. Saladin would tame it.\n\nBinocular reflection catches his sight over the smoldering cliff, looking down in his direction. Unfamiliar voices echo across the rocks. A figure calls out, and others join them. Between hacking coughs, Saladin counts half a dozen hostiles. His fingers ache with chill, and his lungs sting as if coated in rime. He exhales unsteadily. For a moment, Saladin imagines Lady Jolder plunging through the clouds, booming with laughter. He imagines her obliterating the cliffside with a colossal javelin of Arc lightning without hesitation. These nameless men die, and she keeps laughing until Saladin joins. His near miss becomes an embarrassing story embellished round a campfire until another takes its place, and it is forgotten. Lucidity falters, and in this moment, he can almost breathe the ash. Smell the stormy night air. Feel the warmth of the fire, of his friends. As real as worn memories, rosed with age.\n\nLight condenses into Saladin's fingers. Arc lines fork across the bark as he grips the branch impaled through his shoulder. It hooks upward from his chest; better to break it, he thinks. Fingers dig and scorch pulp. They bite in and twist. Wood pops and splinters as a bullet snaps through the pine canopy behind him. Then another, closer this time as the sound of rifle fire echoes down the cliff face. Saladin focuses his Light into the edge of his palm and slashes the splintered branch free, leaving him dangling on a stub of wood. He takes a shaky breath and swings a tingling leg back to push off the trunk behind him, bracing his boot to support his weight against the wood and lift his bone clear from the branch. His armor is slick with blood now, and he can feel a fracture in his bone. Pain he can abide. He recites it as mantra. The dive to the ground below would be dangerous. Saladin prepares to push off and jump.\n\nA round strikes his armored torso, knocking the air from his lungs. His foot slips and kicks out violently. His weight shifts on the broken branch, catching hard on his collar and sending fissures through his fractured bone. Saladin roars over the gunfire and grips his shoulder.\n\n\"Isirah! Get. Me. Off. This. Branch,\" he snarls.\n\nHis Ghost materializes before him. \"I taught you better than to rely on me,\" Isirah reproves him. She swoops behind Saladin for cover. \"You're not dead yet. You're capable of this.\" \n\nSaladin strains to regain his footing. He lifts his head and wheezes as his lungs expand. Several figures above congregate around a large object, a blur of metal he recognizes as a flak cannon.\n\n\"I yield,\" Saladin laughs weakly. \n\n\"What would you do if I weren't here, Forge? If I'd been killed?\" His Ghost taps the back of his head with a pellet of Light. \"It's just you and your Light. What little you have left.\"\n\nHim and his Light against a weapon of war. But they were just men, and he: a fiend of fire. \n\nSaladin conjures waning star-fire from his bones: the last vestiges of his will, burnt as offering to the Light. Flame billows and radiates through his flesh, swirling between the gaps in his armor, moving to consume the branch. Sap hemorrhages in hissing bubbles from the wood around him. Flames overtake the branch, joining those building from the Iron Lord's armor. Ash wisps upward on agitated, anabatic wind. With a pop, he descends into freefall.\n\nBranches snap against his legs as he picks up speed. Saladin gropes for the axe on his back with his good hand. As fingers find hilt, and Solar Light engulfs the weapon. He swings the axe from its strap and sinks the flaming blade into the tree, slowing his descent and carving a wake of sparking embers toward the forest floor. The pull threatens to rend him apart. He holds until he can hold no longer and plummets the final 10 meters: wreckage striking bedrock with a wet thud.\n\nBlood-vapor steams from the charred forest floor around him as he comes to. Overhead, the forest canopy explodes with a flak shell detonation. Fragmentation whistles through the air, showering the forest with ragged chunks of metal. Saladin kicks off the trunk at his feet and rolls his ravaged body onto his rocket launcher. Muscle threatens to separate as he hoists the launcher to his shoulder. Saladin howls, a wounded beast's final challenge. He presses the split launcher shut with his forearm and welds the metal with Solar heat before fumbling to find the trigger. Another shell booms; dense pine canopy opens momentarily from the blast wave. Saladin sees a clean line to the ridge, takes aim, and squeezes. He watches the rocket fly as shards of flak-iron carve lines through his face.","icon":"/common/destiny2_content/icons/f5990e85659eea5983fc092bbff5123f.png"}},"903781538":{"hash":903781538,"index":1989,"redacted":false,"name":null,"iconImagePath":null,"colorImagePath":null,"displayProperties":{"name":"III - Plea Deal","description":"Saladin breaks through the tree line on the backslope of a collapsed bluff. Behind him lies the breadth of the old forest, shadow slinking away before the dawn. He and Isirah had trekked two kilometers from Kepre's village to close in on the location of a Golden Age receiver.\n\nAtop the bluff, Saladin turns his attention to a steep sunken basin in front of him, fallen in on itself under the pressure of one of Earth's many invasions. A rusted antenna from a bygone era still penetrates through the rubble in the middle of overgrowth, debris, and ruined transmission dishes. Faded block lettering runs down the length of the antenna which read: POINT PERIHELION. Centered below the antenna, Saladin could make out a tarnished hatch.\n\n\"The signal in the longhouse was a recording device,\" Isirah explains. \"Its transmission was received here.\"\n\n\"So, the thief planted a recon device unbeknownst to the villagers,\" Saladin concludes.\n\n\"Clever way to find openings,\" Isirah says. \"I'm also detecting electric current. There must be a power cell underneath all that rubble. Felwinter Peak could make use of it,\" she notes.\n\n\"Raiders seem unlikely. No violence in the village, no territorial claims… and they stole a pig, of all things,\" Saladin says. \"Sounds more like a starving animal.\" \n\nIsirah hums in consideration. \"Wild animals get put down when they start killing livestock.\"\n\nSaladin chuckles. \"And feral wolves become loyal hounds when shown mercy. Isn't that right, Isirah?\"\n\n\"Sometimes. Eventually.\" Isirah sighs. \"You want to protect the people here? Empower the Lords with whatever tech is running down there. Impose order before a Warlord seizes control. Don't chase strays hoping to tame them.\"\n\n\"As luck would have it, we can do both.\" Saladin's mouth curls into a rare smirk.\n\n\"Luck isn't something we should depend on, Forge.\"\n\nOnce at the antenna base, Saladin notes traces of rubbed away rust on the hatch's hinges. He surveys the many gaps and recesses scattered through the field of debris around him, awaiting an ambush from one of them. When none appear, Saladin scoffs, as if offended, and spins the hatch wheel until it thuds loudly and drops open.\n\nSaladin recoils as putrid odor floods his nose. He takes the axe from his back and sets it aflame. Flickering illumination scatters shadows throughout the dark hatchway. The room is of moderate size, mostly buried beneath encroaching nature. It appears to be the remnants of a control tower erected to bridge a communicational divide. Several preserved slogans in long-dead languages line the interior walls, their meanings lost on him.\n\n\"Anyone?\" he asks.\n\n\"Carbon levels suggest a handful of recent inhabitants, some decomposition, but electrical interference is scrambling my readings.\"\n\n\"Old-fashioned way, then,\" Saladin says, slipping into the opening. His feet slam to the floor under the weight of his armor, followed by Isirah. Sudden movement catches his eye. He prepares to swing as a silhouette dashes toward him and squeals.\n\nHe snatches the pig mid-dash. It thrashes in his grasp. \"Elmi,\" Saladin grumbles. Holding the squirming hog, he sweeps the lit axe over the room, stopping to examine a shadowed corner full of stacked garbage. \n\nIsirah homes in on the same spot and ignites her flashlight to reveal a face—a filthy shoulder—and a gun barrel half-buried and hidden among the refuse. \n\n\"Good pig.\" The young girl has him at gunpoint, flatfooted. Saladin's brow furrows as he eyes his opponent: no older than fourteen, a wilder-child girl wrapped in furs and smears of dirt.\n\n\"I will put a hole in you.\" Her unsteady voice grapples with seldom spoken syllables. \"No lie!\" The scrawny girl's dim eyes and matted hair are silvered with persistent trauma.\n\nSaladin steps forward, his massive frame overshadowing the wilder-child girl. \"You're not going to kill me, girl.\" \n\n\"I'll take your demon when you're dead.\" The girl hesitates for a moment before yelling, \"I know it gives magic. Then Jaxxen will be afraid too!\" Experience had clearly deafened her to empathy; morality was a luxury for a civilized age she'd never known.\n\nIsirah bursts out laughing behind Saladin. \"Try.\"\n\nThe girl swings the rifle to Isirah and fires. Saladin drops Elmi—to clattering squeals—and stops the bullet in the air with his hand before it contacts his Ghost. He picks the round from the interior backplate of his gauntlet, blood running from the fresh hole in his palm. \"Whoever you stole these from is underpacking their grains.\"\n\nShe hisses at him and hastily tries to slip another dirty round into the chamber. Saladin rushes the girl. He slaps the rifle from her hands and lifts her aloft by her scruff. She stares directly into his eyes, accepting the deathblow to come. \n\n\"Now that you're listening…\" Saladin places her feet to floor. \"Sit down, child.\"\n\nHer expression is a caked mask of survival fugue, a hare's heart from expiration. He had felt that waking confusion before. Risen into nothing, with nothing.\n\nSaladin knows the penalty for theft is death, but that action was final. He also knows the strength of potential, of justice beyond the letter, of mercy. She needs something of sense to hold against the barrage of madness the world had become.\n\n\"Your name?\" \n\n\"Just kill me.\"\n\n\"I'm not a Warlord, girl.\" Saladin, a banneret, plants his molten axe firmly in the ground, blood from his hand sizzling down the haft. \"I won't show you death. I'll show you a way to live.\"\n\nStill, her eyes do not leave the burning axe for some time. She refuses rations as no one had ever given her something without the intent to extract far more in return.\n\n\"Last time. Name?\"\n\n\"Fera.\"\n\n\"If you were hungry, I'm sure that village would have taken you in. Winter's soon, and stealing… What if you'd driven that village to starvation?\"\n\nThe girl stares through him vacantly. \"Jaxxen said bring gifts; promised to give my brother back.\"\n\nIsirah patches Saladin's hand with Light. \"And did he?\" she asks.\n\nFera's vapid expression falters. Saladin eyes the refuse pile behind her under Isirah's light. A wrapped child's body is buried within the mound. \n\nHe places a gentle hand on the girl's shoulder. \"Take me to Jaxxen.\"\n\nThe hike to the Warlord's commune is several days north. Over the journey, Saladin teaches the girl to trap rabbits and hunt game. Where she sees a predator inflicting their will, Saladin explains the mercy of delivering a quick death. He tells her the wolf does not hunt for themselves, but for the pack. Alone, they are mongrels, driven by instinct and hunger. That violence spreads. It is the promise of the pack that keeps them true. It is the order that binds us together.\n\nThey make camp on the outskirts of Jaxxen's hold. Saladin rolls stringy meat between his glowing palms, and the smell of cooking hare fills his nostrils. It is a catch from Fera's first sturdy trap, a bounty they share in peace.\n\n\"You see? Together, we can provide for each other.\" Saladin hands Fera a cooked leg. \"This is how we go from simply surviving, to living. Community, order, laws. That is how we move forward.\"\n\n\"What are laws?\" Fera asks, mouth full of rabbit.\n\n\"They're rules. Promises of how to treat each other.\"\n\n \"Promises break…\" she says, swallowing.\n\n\"People like me make sure they're kept. People like you could too.\" Saladin sees her confusion and continues, \"Sometimes when a Lord can't remain to protect an area, we appoint a vassal in our stead.\"\n\nFera looks at him quizzically.\n\n\"Someone to watch over the woods while I'm gone. Someone like you who understands why promises should be kept.\" Saladin unclasps a chain from his neck. \"This makes you one of our pack, Fera. A wolf. And we protect our own.\"\n\n\"How?\" she asks, grasping the talisman tightly as Saladin hangs it around her fragile neck.\n\n\"Like you, there will be others who need a place. Find them. Bring them back to the village you stole from. Promise to protect each other. That is how.\"\n\nIn the morning, Fera takes Saladin to the edge of Jaxxen's encampment where the woods give way to craggy rock and dry dirt. The Iron Lord tells her to await his return at their campsite. He strides into Jaxxen's camp as alarm yells raise defenders. Fera steps back into the tree line, but she does not leave.\n\n**\n\nFera watches the Iron Lord tear through body after body with brutal efficiency—a savage, blood-drunk beast. The young girl devours every violent image of its axe spilling sizzling crimson. She delights in the beast's hollow reception to their screams for mercy. Her wide eyes fill with lightning, flame, and gore. It is a painting of cathartic balance. Though she does not know the words, it is a vengeful righteousness that takes hold in her. The beast is Jaxxen's punishment for misdeeds: promised order imposed through dominance.\n\nFera rubs her talisman when the Warlord Jaxxen emerges, amethyst-Light surrounding him. A moment of fear creeps into her heart as Jaxxen bellows laughter and charges. But he too falls under an obliterating column of lightning called down by the beast's thunderous roar. All that remains is the crackle of his cindered bones flaking into ash.\n\nShe smiles.\n\n**\n\nSaladin stands at the edge of Jaxxen's burning encampment. He looks to the lightning-scorched earth where Jaxxen had stood and summons Isirah.\n\nIsirah surveys the aftermath. \"Good. But you're going to let the girl go? Stealing food and attacking an Iron Lord are death offenses, and you want to do nothing?\" Isirah's doubt is palpable. Saladin knows she's seen how wild things age. \"You're procrastinating,\" she fumes.\n\n\"Fera's young enough to find a different future.\" Saladin meets Isirah's gaze. \"Just like I did.\"\n\nIsirah whirs with exasperation. \"The world is full of wayward orphans, Forge. Your job is to enforce Iron laws, not interpret gray areas.\"\n\n\"I am an Iron Lord, and our laws are mine to interpret as I see fit,\" Saladin snaps. \"We'll salvage the battery and bring her back to Kepre with the pig. Then we're leaving.\" His voice is stern and unyielding. \"That's the end of it.\"","icon":"/common/destiny2_content/icons/f5990e85659eea5983fc092bbff5123f.png"}},"903781539":{"hash":903781539,"index":1988,"redacted":false,"name":null,"iconImagePath":null,"colorImagePath":null,"displayProperties":{"name":"II - Wake","description":"Burning grass fills Saladin's nostrils like smelling salts. He stirs from the abyss into a new life, back pressed against a towering pine that smolders with heat. Saladin blinks blurriness from his eyes to see the crater on the cliff where his rocket struck. Good, he thinks, picking fragments of metal from his plate. Isirah sinks through the smoke just overhead and levitates in front of his face, Light still coursing through her frame.\n\n\"Welcome back. You lost,\" Isirah says, her voice smooth as verglas.\n\n\"It was a draw.\" Saladin stands and fumbles with a talisman hanging from his neck. He tucks the stamped iron insignia into the gorget of his armor. \"They're dead, aren't they?\"\n\n\"There are a million raiders and one of you,\" Isirah snaps. She drifts into his eyeline. \"A draw is a loss. We need to do better than that.\"\n\n\"We?\" Saladin narrows his eyes and yanks his stuck axe from the scorched trunk and slings it.\n\n\"Fix what you break.\" Isirah had imparted this lesson many times. \"You should have opened fire on the road without hesitation. I warned you they were bait.\"\n\n\"How long are you going to rest your laurels on that prediction?\" Saladin groans.\n\nIsirah's shell tightens like a coiling viper. \"Do you have a plan from here?\"\n\n\"Continue sweeping east. The broadcast code might have been Golden Age, but the signal was weak when we caught it. Can't be far, and our patrol can wait until we clear this up.\"\n\n\"Fine observation. I agree,\" the Ghost says curtly, floating off ahead.\n\nSaladin looks to the burning pine and uncuffs his gauntlet. Strands of ruddy leather stick beneath his nails as he removes the glove and presses his hand to bark. This tree had likely stood for centuries, roots deep in the soil, branches carving territory into the greater forest. So it was for many other trees. They all had their space—a crown shyness shared by old things. One born in this forest might assume this tree had always been. \n\nHe feels the warmth radiating from the roasting heartwood above; Light still crackles in the ember-split wood. His Light. Left alone, it would destroy this old pine, consume it from the inside out. Saladin anchors the Light to his core and commands it to return, dousing the burn. The tree will heal, and today's wound will fade. This gouge marks a point of struggle surpassed, and given enough time, will fade into familiarity.\n\n\"Someone is coming,\" Isirah reports in a quiet voice.\n\n\"Are they armed?\" Saladin whispers, hand slowly drifting to the haft of his slung axe.\n\nBefore Isirah can answer, a thin man in coarse linen fumbles into view. Terror paints his face as his eyes fall on Saladin.\n\n\"I—I have no weapon,\" the man says with a thick local accent. He eyes Saladin's equipment. \"You… are Iron Lord?\" Awe washes over the man's face.\n\nIsirah zips between him and Saladin. \"Did you not hear the explosions? What do they teach you people out here?\"\n\n\"Many stray dogs fight here.\" The man's gaze drops to the ground. \"Sometimes scraps are left after. Weapons—\"\n\n\"Like a buzzard,\" Saladin accuses.\n\n\"No!\" The man throws his hands in the air. \"Others steal from village. We find weapons to fight back.\"\n\n\"I see.\" Saladin nods.\n\n\"Do you or your people have a radio?\" Isirah asks.\n\nThe man lets out a curt laugh before realizing the Ghost is serious. \"Oh. Uh, no?\"\n\n\"Then this is a waste of our time,\" Isirah whispers to Saladin.\n\nThe man steps forward. \"Please, wait, find mercy in your heart.\" He braces a hand on his thigh and takes a slow knee. \"Iron Lords protect people. You kill monsters.\" His eyes dart between man and Ghost. \"You want payment?\"\n\nSaladin sighs. \"We're not mercenaries.\"\n\n\"Food, then? Better than what can be foraged here,\" he says, offering a blackened crust of bread from a twine rucksack. \"Cleaned armor and clothes? Blankets, clean water, and… and good company by warm fire.\" The man nods eagerly. \n\nSaladin turns the meager portion of stale bread in his hand. Between winter and latent radiation, reliable food is scarce here, making thievery into a grave offense. He knows the man is lying about their resources, but only out of desperation. The kind that sends you running toward explosions. \"What is your name?\"\n\n\"Ah! Kepre. I am Kepre.\"\n\n\"You said you were being stolen from, Kepre?\"\n\n\"More than can be replaced. Last thieves came, the village lost Elmi,\" Kepre says, holding back tears. \"We will starve if thieves are not stopped.\"\n\n\"Show me.\"\n\nThe man leads them down a lightly trafficked footpath marked by hand-driven stakes bearing illegibly worn highway signs. Southeast, until the trees thin and the smell of mudded livestock and wheat overtakes the pine. Isirah and Saladin hang several steps behind Kepre on approach to a small and lightly fenced swine enclosure with a pathway bisecting it. Saladin notes the fence itself serves more to stop the three pigs from wandering off than to keep anything out. He quickly surveys a handful of rusty corrugated metal dwellings that wind out from the swine run and encircle a better maintained storage structure and longhouse. Beside the longhouse lies a humble stable for a goat that chews at Saladin's sleeves when he passes by.\n\nThe handful of families living here stand and stare as Saladin sloshes through the muddy entrance, Isirah floating close behind. Kepre heralds the duo as saviors. The words feel coarse in Saladin's ears, but he graciously shakes the people's hands and takes their stories as evidence toward finding their thieves. There's a prideful nature to their expressions, and the meager gifts they offer. The kind that comes from starting with nothing and arriving at something. Saladin couldn't help but smile at their perseverance.\n\n\"They took Elmi from pen,\" Kepre says. \"Scared our goat. My son and I chased them, but they made off with her, along with half the dried meat stores.\" He wrings his hands.\n\n\"Elmi is a pig,\" Saladin says flatly.\n\nKepre nods, teary-eyed. \"Only girl hog. Without her… without her, we starve.\"\n\nIsirah flitters close to Saladin as she emits a wide sweeping scan from her shell. \"Forge, I doubt they're aware, but that Golden Age transmission is receiving a signal from the longhouse.\"","icon":"/common/destiny2_content/icons/f5990e85659eea5983fc092bbff5123f.png"}},"903781541":{"hash":903781541,"index":1990,"redacted":false,"name":null,"iconImagePath":null,"colorImagePath":null,"displayProperties":{"name":"IV - Few Words Between Them","description":"Winter wind sweeps over the forest of pine; fresh snowfall smattering tops the canopy. Isirah mentions the pines are much taller than when Saladin had last seen them, but he cannot imagine their aging. He only sees what is there now. If he could have stood beneath their needles and watched their 50 years of growth, would he notice the difference?\n\nThe spot where he had burned the Warlord's hold is covered in new growth and snow. He draws a mental line from it to the bluff where he'd met Fera all those years ago, then to Kepre's village. Blurry smoke ascends through woods and snow flurry—a cooking fire, maybe. Bacon, he hoped. Saladin leans over the ridge where he had fallen before and steps over the edge.\n\nUnder thin slush, Saladin and Isirah find the once well-trodden path toward Kepre's village. No one meets them on the road—though Isirah catches several signs of sudden movement on her scanners. \"Animals,\" Saladin suggests. Looking through the breaks in the branches, he notices a thickening black smoke against the snowfall.\n\nA ghostly mist winds through the thinning pines as the duo reach Kepre's village. Smells of singed hair and burnt pork invade the winter air. Iron Lord and Ghost exchange looks before she decompiles. Saladin rushes into the clearing, Fool's Remedy in hand and snow crunching under his heavy boots. He follows glistening blood lines soaked into the soot and snow, through empty pens devoid of hay, past hollow wooden skeletons of rotted homes, until they meet at the rusted frame of a desiccated longhouse. Through snowblind and moth-ridden tatters, he sees them.\n\nGraves. Lines of them. Then piles of stone. Bare mounds of shallow churned earth follow. Smoke rises behind them over a dug-out depression. Saladin fixates on the number of them. The groupings. He counts them as he walks, until he reaches the edge of the smoking pit, and the numbers lose all meaning. A huddled, smoking mass of carnage lay tangled in the pit before him. Cauterized panic. Still smoldering in the frigid air.\n\nSaladin stares into the sunken sockets of a charred face. He imagines Kepre's face staring back at him. Was it him? Features all burned away. Years older. Saladin turns to see Isirah studying something in the longhouse. Through flames rising in his eyes he sees a crude reproduction of an Iron sigil nestled in a wolf's blackened skull.\n\n**\n\nThe Golden Age antenna no longer received signals. It was bent, unable to discern anything for itself, but still able to throw noise into the sky. A new settlement had formed around it, fenced with wooden spears, and built along the basin in a spiral shape. Saladin makes his way inside the oddly vacant encampment unharried, and descends. Where once a hatch had led him down into a center of communication, now a hollow building lay carved open. A path of set stones had been pressed into the ground over years of foot traffic; crimson moss takes root in the mud that fill in the gaps. It flows underground to an open hall, like an estuary. He tells Isirah to stay outside, to watch his back.\n\nSilvered eyes pierce through the dim hall fashioned from the surrounding comms station. Saladin watches the moonlight gleaming off them like two dancing spirits. He sees himself in that fearless stare.\n\n\"I didn't imagine I'd see you here again, young one.\"\n\n\"It's been a long time since anyone called me young.\" Fera, Packmaster, sits upon a scrapheap of a throne at the rear of the hall, eight rugged gunners flanking her. She's a woman now, several decades of age and violence etched into her sun-scarred skin and wizened face. Her finger taps a half-missing ear, long healed. \"You came from far away. What for?\"\n\n\"Rumors of rabid wolves prowling the outlands.\" Saladin looks to the men flanking Fera. \"Are these yours?\"\n\nFera leers at the crest on Saladin's armor. \"My pack. Most are hunting now.\"\n\n\"I removed the Warlord, and you took his place.\" Saladin voice is thick with rage.\n\n\"Same as it ever was,\" Fera muses. \"Someone had to keep order in your absence.\"\n\nSaladin scans the room with disgust. \"This is not what I taught you.\"\n\nFera smiles and looks to her comrades. \"Isn't it? They're orphans of the forest, like me.\"\n\n\"You lost yourself!\" Saladin barks as he steps forward, his finger slipping inside the trigger guard of his holstered weapon.\n\nFera cackles breathily. \"Because I followed you. I asked forgiveness for stealing, and they took my ear… So next time I met them, I took back. It continued, until they lost everything.\" She gestures behind her to her grinning disciples and stashes of stolen goods. \"The pack decides what is best.\"\n\n\"Iron Lords don't slaughter innocent villages. We don't starve people. I don't murder children,\" Saladin growls, heat building under his skin.\n\n \"What do you do when a Warlord refuses to bow? Order is imposed, old, gray Lord. Or have you forgotten your lessons?\" She shifts in her seat. \"I learned that when you slapped the rifle out of my hand. When you leveled Jaxxen's camp. I understood.\"\n\n\"I made a mistake thinking what you needed was mercy.\" Saladin exhales.\n\nThe Iron Lord swiftly unholsters Fool's Remedy. A quick burst drops Fera's right-most wolf, leaving the pack stunned. Saladin steps forward and kicks Fera's throne, sending her and the chair skipping across the ground like a pond-stone, until it crashes and pins her to the far wall.\n\nFera's left-most wolf draws a wicked machete and lunges. Saladin whips the axe from his back with his off-hand and cleaves the bandit clean pelvis to crown. The two halves slump limply to the floor. Horror freezes the pack as blood pools around them. Fera's shrill voice screams, \"Put him down!\"\n\nBullets cross in the air as muzzle flashes erupt in every direction. Saladin pivots to face the bulk of the pack, rattling off rounds as freely as his armor and body are receiving them. He kills two. There is no cover. There is no retreat. This is a reckoning.\n\nWolves whine and die around him. A shotgun blast catches his shoulder, drawing blood and disarming his pistol. He staggers back under the debt of his wounds. Red drips from beneath his epaulet, but pain is the furthest thing from his mind. He ignites the arm in fiery Light and casts a Solar hammer that caves in the shotgunner's skull with a sizzling pop.\n\nThe second to last wolf drops an empty weapon and tries to run. Saladin heaves his axe across the hall and catches the coward in the back. They collapse under the heft of the molten blade and combust. He turns to the last wolf frantically trying to reload their weapon. They back into a corner as they rack their rifle and spray rounds. Saladin charges through the gunfire and slams them against the wall. He unleashes a barrage of Arc-wreathed fists that pulverize his foe into convulsing pulp.\n\nSaladin sees Fera, still pinned and struggling beneath the throne. Burning wreckage around her.\n\nHe grimaces as he flips the throne off her, wraps hands around her neck, and lifts her aloft. His fingers crush the air from her throat until they feel spine. His body aches. He pauses to catch his breath. To see remorse in her eyes. \n\nFera places a gentle hand on his fingers. \"How long until one comes to repay your violence?\" she wheezes.\n\nTheir eyes meet. Saladin's grip loosens.\n\nWith her other hand, Fera plunges a narrow blade into Saladin's neckline. He winces and turns to see the thin sliver of metal in her hand. Saladin meets her eyes again. There is no fear. His grip tightens until bone shatters. He releases and lets her body crumple where it lands. He watches the life slip from her eyes, replaced by pain, trembling near death. \n\nSaladin picks up his sidearm and delivers her one final mercy.\n\nIsirah floats near the settlement's fence, a small shadow against early morning sun piercing through snow flurries. Saladin climbs the distance to her before she heals his wounds. The journey is a purifying penance, he tells himself. \n\nPain he can abide.","icon":"/common/destiny2_content/icons/f5990e85659eea5983fc092bbff5123f.png"}},"932328955":{"hash":932328955,"index":1986,"redacted":false,"name":null,"iconImagePath":null,"colorImagePath":null,"displayProperties":{"name":"","description":"","icon":"/common/destiny2_content/icons/b4d505c2841cc0bee7a8072262b3a981.png"}},"935120007":{"hash":935120007,"index":1976,"redacted":false,"name":null,"iconImagePath":null,"colorImagePath":null,"displayProperties":{"name":"Altars of Reflection—Conclusion","description":"ACCESS: RESTRICTED\r\nDECRYPTION KEY: QF4LYZX16G$IKO-006\r\nREP #: 221-HIVE-SAV\r\nAGENT(S): LIN-357\r\nSUBJ: Altars of Reflection—Conclusion\r\n\r\n1.

I moved forward with invocation of a personal item anyway, despite previous report concluding that it was unnecessary. Testing continued with the cloak I have kept from back then, the one I was wearing when I was found. I don't know what I was expecting from it—just that after all that time not remembering, my curiosity won out. I wanted to know.\r\n\r\n2. The memory was… like a key in a lock, all the rest laid open to me once I remembered this one thing.\r\n\r\nThe first time I witnessed the memory, I barely processed any of what was happening; I was so caught up in simply looking at her. I forgot to breathe. She had the most luminous blue eyes… how could I have ever forgotten her?\r\n\r\nEverything in my head was jumbled, all the things I'd forgotten were trying to be heard at once, and she was the only constant. So I used the item again, this time intending to make a coherent report, thinking I could process by writing it all down. I just wound up watching again, caught up in remembering the three of us. This awful set of moments, suspended in perfect replica. \r\n\r\nBefore this, I didn't recall anything of the incident, even who my fireteam was at the time. I'd wondered what might be in that gap, and why I hesitated even when I was curious. It wasn't enough to know that I had survived and should not return. I think, despite all that wondering, some part of me didn't want to remember. \r\n\r\nBut that's how lies happen, isn't it? In the places we don't want to look. Little by little, we let the weeds grow and the shadows encroach, and we tell ourselves there's nothing in the overgrowth.

Logical next steps in analysis involve changing a variable in the known functional equation. I've taken the liberty of borrowing some items from others in order to conduct some tests regarding expectations—it is worth assessing how much influence the viewer has on the outcome.\r\n\r\n2. First test—Introduction of reasonably generic items. As expected, a chunk of Glimmer did nothing. A broken-off piece from the grip of a new sidearm, purchased specifically for this purpose—next to nothing. For a moment, there was a shadow, something that vaguely resembled the gunsmith at work or in conversation, but no memory replay as seen in the items known to produce memories of VIP #7282.\r\n\r\n3. Second test—I had an acquaintance borrow a trinket from a friend of theirs whom I have not met. The item is a medallion smaller than my palm, with old, rubbed-faint engravings. Following the introduction of this item to the Altar, a visible memory resulted, playing out in third person much like the other memories. I recorded details of this memory for reference and confirmation of accuracy. (Specifics omitted here as irrelevant.)\r\n\r\nOnce a recording had been made and committed, I accessed the file provided by the owner of the item. This file included summaries of what he thought were the most likely memories to be associated with the item. As you can see, details of what I observed matched one of those summaries. Owner's Ghost to provide additional context if necessary, either on my return or when another Hidden agent reaches out.\r\n\r\nWould like to recommend that another agent repeats the same test to see if they can view something different.\r\n\r\n4. While we had no reason to doubt the previously revealed memories, all this adds an additional layer of certainty: that which we can ascertain via the Altars is the truth, full and clear. The only remaining doubts are regarding why, and which memories. VIP #7282 is known to be cunning but has ultimately been truthful in previous dealings with the Vanguard. Regrettably, these things are not mutually exclusive. \r\n\r\n5. I had additional plans for analysis of the Altars involving personal items and memory, but I am reconsidering the wisdom in doing so, as well as the necessity. Beyond confirming that the memories produced are repeatable, true, and personal, do we need to know more? I will be moving on to the substance of the world next. \r\n\r\nMESSAGE ENDS","icon":"/common/destiny2_content/icons/fdd44a1d92f672d89041b4837fdb1b13.png"}},"935120012":{"hash":935120012,"index":1971,"redacted":false,"name":null,"iconImagePath":null,"colorImagePath":null,"displayProperties":{"name":"Altars of Reflection—Control","description":"ACCESS: RESTRICTED\r\nDECRYPTION KEY: QF4LYZX16G$IKO-006\r\nREP #: 218-HIVE-SAV\r\nAGENT(S): LIN-357\r\nSUBJ: Altars of Reflection—Control\r\n\r\n1. With the perimeter secured and all sensors ready for analysis, there is no immediate further obstacle to the initial experiments with Deepsight. On Vanguard authorization, I've borrowed one of the existing artifacts that has been used to produce and view VIP #7282's memories. Item: a shard of the crystal that #7282 used recently as a protective measure, cf. REP # 197-HIVE-SAV. \r\n\r\n2. In summary, following the known and established process, there is no deviation from what was previously reported. The memory of #7282's death and subsequent acquisition of Light played back as expected, identical in every beat. (See attached file for additional details as necessary.) This is not unexpected, and the recording, etc., have been made largely for archival purposes.\r\n\r\n3. Subsequent repetitions of the same process revealed additional words from #7282. Perhaps foolishly, I replied to portions of her dialogue that seemed to request a response. However, there was no explicit answer—I believe it is safe to conclude that there is no awareness of hers here, and what is heard is likely a recording coded to this specific memory and/or object. Her use of this method to influence and sow doubt is not unexpected.\r\n\r\n4. As a test, I used the crystal item to invoke Deepsight in the same fashion I used previously, this time with the intent of viewing something different—there are plentiful records of #7282's interactions with Vanguard and Reef personnel around the larger crystal this piece was retrieved from. However, none of these were viewable. The same item only allowed viewing of the same memory, suggesting a permanent association. I have some additional analysis planned to confirm this. \r\n\r\nAt first glance, these observations imply that if we wish to discover further memories, we will need to collect additional items, likely of personal relevance to #7282.

I arrived onsite and made my way into the Altar space. It doesn't appear to have changed much, if at all, from earlier provided telemetry. As predicted, there were barriers to access: several of the Lucent Brood obstructed my passage and were subsequently dispatched without much trouble. Additionally, the same complication as previously reported blocked the way—Hive runes. Parsing their nature and repetition of specific patterns was required to gain full access to the Altar. \r\n\r\n2. On the topic of the presented resistance: there were significantly fewer Hive defenders than could have been mustered, given intelligence on available forces. Based on the token nature of this resistance and the fact that VIP #7282 surely knows that Guardians have been here, it can be assumed that the defense is not a sincere attempt to keep us out. Historical precedent exists for setting a guard on a location or item to make it appear more attractive. \r\n\r\nPrecedent also exists for opening the way for Guardians to participate in the Hive sword logic. I do not yet have reason to believe this is taking place here, especially given the severance of #7282's connection to the Worm Gods that have otherwise led her species, but it does not pay to be incautious around the Hive.\r\n\r\n3. Once appropriate precautions were taken against any further incursions, I deployed sensors to record what data is possible, focusing on the central Altar and its exterior boundaries. Simultaneously, it was necessary to assess the available space for myself; impressions follow.\r\n\r\nIt is more aesthetically appealing than we usually associate with Hive—only the structures bear vague resemblance to those on Luna. The colors are pleasing, far removed from scarlet and rot, and the area lacks jagged edges or significant quantities of bone. Structurally, it is a space clearly built to highlight the central area, and indeed, it draws one to the Altar itself.\r\n\r\nAll told, in architecture alone, the creator demonstrates a clear evolution, presumably mirroring her own.\r\n\r\n4. On the topic of the structure: although the available space does not appear to have walls, there is a definite boundary. Matter grows foggy, and there is a strong sense of pushback when moving away from the center. Initially, I believed this to be a function of the architecture, but significant willpower was required to force myself to look further into testing the concept. That alone suggests it should be investigated more. \r\n\r\nConscious of the bias in doing so, I am marking it for later experimentation, as it would involve straying from the central objective. Further data forthcoming.\r\n\r\nMESSAGE ENDS","icon":"/common/destiny2_content/icons/fdd44a1d92f672d89041b4837fdb1b13.png"}},"935120014":{"hash":935120014,"index":1969,"redacted":false,"name":null,"iconImagePath":null,"colorImagePath":null,"displayProperties":{"name":"Altars of Reflection—Dispatch","description":"ACCESS: RESTRICTED\r\nDECRYPTION KEY: QF4LYZX16G$IKO-006\r\nREP #: 216-HIVE-SAV \r\nAGENT(S): LIN-357 \r\nSUBJ: Altars of Reflection—Dispatch\r\n\r\n1. Regarding the power known as Deepsight and its use within VIP #7282's throne world:\r\nSome Guardians have already used this power to access secret pockets of space. Hidden agents have dubbed them \"Altars of Reflection\" for now. There, the invocation of Deepsight in concert with significant objects has enabled us to view memories belonging to #7282.\r\n\r\n2. Access to this power requires spending time with the Relic, and subsequently, in one of the Pyramids. Long-term exposure to Darkness in this manner carries inherent risk, and the process is nontrivial. However, in the interest of learning everything possible about this space and the relevant VIP, certain chances must be taken.   \r\n\r\nConsidering the sensitive nature of the topic, reports should be directed subject to the attention of IKO-006 only. \r\n\r\n3. So far, it is estimated that Guardians have been able to view memories that #7282 wants. This supposition is upheld by #7282's specific and personal input on the memories in question. But why these memories? This remains a worthwhile question to answer in order to understand #7282's larger goal.\r\n\r\n4.

I have dedicated lifetimes to studying the infinite permutations of reality. I have lived longer than any other Guardian by orders of magnitude, much of it outside what you experience as time. But with the loss of Sagira, the time I have left in a Human lifespan is infinitesimal; less than a mote in the vast sands of time.

Which is why I have made my deal with the devil.\r\n\r\nI have willingly submitted to Savathûn and allowed her to take my place among the Vanguard.\r\n\r\nThe Vanguard have  fought like trapped animals for too long. They hoard secrets; every fact they learn gets crammed into the barrel of a gun and fired at the heart of our newest target. We are losing this war despite individual, pyrrhic victories, and what pitiful harm Savathûn can inflict with our limited resources pales against the value of this opportunity. The Witch Queen sits on a throne of secrets accreted over a billion years. While she huddles in the crumbling ruin of our city, I am left alone in her storied halls to learn all she has seen. \r\n\r\nZavala and Ikora are dear friends and noble souls, but they are adventurers. They see immediate problems and crave immediate solutions, and their compassion blinds them to what can be won through sacrifice—particularly from a man who is, on the scale of Guardian lives, already dead.

A tea set balanced delicately beside him on the split log he used as a seat. From the other side of the campfire, Saint-14 looked comically oversized as he cradled a blue-and-white ceramic teacup in one large hand. His helmet was off, set in the dirt beside his feet. A slow smile crept across Saint's mouth as he looked at the cup.\n\n\"Not that I mind,\" Devrim continued and motioned with his own teacup. \"It's just—normally, people don't come this prepared for afternoon tea. Although, yours looks like it's, ah, seen a few fights.\" Though Devrim chuckled, his assessment was accurate. Saint's teacup was chipped around the brim; the handle had been broken off at one point and crudely glued back into place.\n\nSaint laughed to himself. \"It is a memento,\" he said. \"The cup is nothing special, just ceramic and paint. But it is the damage that makes it important.\" He finished his tea and offered the cup out to Devrim, who carefully took it to inspect.\n\n\"I forget where I got it. Sat on a shelf in my home long before Osiris and I lived together, before he was exiled.

Very loud. He accidentally knocks my teacup off shelf, breaks it,\" Saint said, lowering his voice. \"The argument stops. We both feel bad. Osiris apologizes, I apologize. Then…\" Saint stared into the fire. \"Then, he touches my cheek. His eyes say things that words cannot. He leaves. I sweep up the shards and…\"\n\nSaint's voice trailed off into nothingness. The amusement left Devrim's eyes as he looked down into the rippling surface of his tea. \"How is he?\" It was the question Devrim had been too afraid to ask. Saint's shoulders slouched in response, and that was almost all the reply Devrim needed.\n\n\"Not good,\" Saint quietly confessed. \"He is alive. But… his body is there, his mind is not. It is like he is on a journey and cannot find his way home. Or…\" Saint shook his head. He honestly wasn't sure. No one was.\n\nDevrim set his teacup down on the log. He rose and crossed the distance to Saint and then laid a hand on the Titan's shoulder. Devrim looked into Saint's vibrant, mechanical eyes with sympathy. \"Marc and I are having Suraya over for dinner tonight,\" he said with a small, hesitant smile. \"I know it's short notice, but you should come.\"\n\n\"I…\" Saint looked away. \"I shouldn't. I should be with Osiris in case he—\"\n\n\"Osiris has many people waiting by his side tonight. He isn't alone. You shouldn't be either,\" Devrim pressed as he let his hand slip away from Saint's shoulder. \"Dinner.

Red blood flowed down over its flickering green iris. \n\n\"You're all going to die here!\" it hissed.\n\nHan leapt back onto the hood of the car, still holding the Ghost tightly. \"Ghosts are tough to kill—both ours and theirs,\" he said. \"It takes overwhelming firepower, or a special kind of weapon. Something outside the laws of cause and effect. Something paracausal.\"\n\nHan fixed his gaze on the assembled Guardians and crushed the Ghost in his fist. It burst in a flash of bubbling flame.\n\n\"Something like us,\" Han said. \"Like you.\"\n\nA roar echoed from the distant forest. Dark flames erupted from the tree line as Wizards took to the sky.
