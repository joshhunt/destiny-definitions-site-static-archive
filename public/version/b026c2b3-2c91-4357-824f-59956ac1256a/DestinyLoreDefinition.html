The tank churned and hummed, surrounded by botanical pallets carefully labeled but strewn haplessly about. A rabbit rose on its haunches to inspect a clay pot full of berries and herbs.\n\nGlint giggled, only to find himself suddenly plucked from the air by Eido as a porous black pillar bubbled and climbed from her workstation, the acrid smell of burnt sugar erupting with it. She held the Ghost tightly, away from the ripples of steam, and thrust a beaker into a bucket of water and sodium bicarbonate.\n\nEido gently released Glint and wiped her brow.\n\n\"What—what was that?!\" he exclaimed.\n\n\"Concentrated sulfuric acid. Unfortunately, not the degradation effect I was looking for.\"\n\nGlint gave her a meaningful look. \"I thought reading the Deck of Whispers was dangerous enough.\"\n\nEido shook her head. \"An Apothecary is only as dangerous as her ignorance, but the Apothecaries of Riis were masters of botany, herbalism, medicine. Their work was volatile in nature. Secretive. Terminology is sometimes convoluted. Even coded. Or both! As a Scribe, I can't even scratch the surface of some of these old recipes.\"\n\nGlint bobbed knowingly. \"Not to mention that High Speak is incredibly complex. So many words hold so many meanings.\"\n\n\"And their combinations, even more so. Plus, one must understand the original context in these recipes.\" Eido presented a datapad. \"Take this example, likely from some time after the Edge Wars.\"\n\nGlint read until his iris grew wide with wonder. \"Is this saying… dragon's blood? You mean… Ahamkara?\"\n\n\"Not at all. From what I can discern in other texts, it is a shorthand reference to a plant with sap that ran thick, like blood.\"\n\nGlint considered for a moment. \"What if we can't find dragon's blood here?\"\n\n\"Precisely,\" Eido said and pointed to the clay pot beside her. \"If a tonic recipe calls for a berry, are Earth's strawberries a close enough cousin? Chemical experimentation is required, which may open up a world of new possibilities.\"\n\nGlint glanced toward Eido's earlier experiment. \"Or the potential for disaster.\"\n\n\"Either way, the key to unlocking these recipes will take time. Which is in rather limited supply these days, I'm afraid,\" Eido sighed.\n\n\"It's a daunting task. But! There's good news,\" Glint offered. He swirled through the air and landed on Eido's shoulder. \"You've got lots of help.\"","icon":null}},"43003873":{"hash":43003873,"index":2855,"redacted":false,"name":null,"iconImagePath":null,"colorImagePath":null,"displayProperties":{"name":"Shadestalker Greaves","description":"Deep within the maze of the Bazaar, throngs of the City's residents wandered, enjoying all the market had to offer.

The smells of caramelized meat and rosemary wafted on the breeze, past every vendor and artisan.\n\nThe hum of activity was overpowering yet reassuring to Saint-14 as he stopped to watch an older Eliksni expertly weave fabric on a well-worn loom. The woven symbols were unique and unfamiliar to the Exo, but he watched in awe as an iridescent glow emerged within the vibrant cerulean cloth.\n\nFit for a Kell, Saint mused to himself—\n\nBreath caught in his throat; hands shook—\n\nFlashes of memory echoed in his mind. All he could feel in this moment… was shame.\n\nHe hurried past the weaver and through the crowd, landing squarely in front of a tea stand, a sample placed in his hand before he could open his mouth to refuse. He looked down. The opaque liquid steamed in his cup, pungent and medicinal.\n\nLike distilled Darkness, Saint realized—\n\nBreath caught in his throat; hands shook—\n\nFlashes of memory filled his sight. All he could feel in this moment… was sadness.\n\nHe stumbled; apologies and hot liquid spilled all around him as the sounds of the Bazaar became a dull roar in his ears. He needed to escape. The noise, the tea, everything.\n\nHe closed his eyes and then rushed away at a fevered pace.\n\nDaylight had waned against the City's walls when Saint found himself in a quiet area, where vibrant green vines stretched down from above, and below, the silhouette of his helmet stretched long and thin across the floor where Mithrax's weathered medical Servitor often waited. Saint breathed a sigh of relief.\n\nHe was alone.\n\nSaint placed his favorite keepsake, a small stuffed bear, on the Kell's throne. Gently, he adjusted the lavender ribbon at its neck; the crisp satin sat in stark contrast to the bear's hazy black eyes, to its slightly worn ear and well-loved fur. A gift, once a comfort to a child of the City.\n\nA gift, once a comfort to Saint in the face of loss, in the face of—\n\nBreath caught in his throat; hands shook—\n\nFlashes of memory swelled in his heart.\n\nOsiris.\n\nHis strong laugh. His deep, soulful eyes. The warmth of his smile. Of his touch.\n\nMemories of comfort, but all he could feel in this moment… was guilt. Intense and overwhelming, like daggers cutting through him, sharpness bleeding through sweetness. Saint breathed deeply and stared at the medical equipment around the empty throne before him.\n\n\"The cost of my joy,\" Saint whispered, and he wept.","icon":null}},"825495813":{"hash":825495813,"index":2831,"redacted":false,"name":null,"iconImagePath":null,"colorImagePath":null,"displayProperties":{"name":"Noxious Vetiver","description":"The weaver held his handcrafted basket close to his chest, mandibles clicking in disappointment as he surveyed the disarray of modern flasks and burettes scattered among the more traditional tools of an apothecary.\n\n\"Have you gotten lost on your way to market, weaver?\" a voice called out.\n\nNamrask turned calmly toward Eido's steely gaze. \"You treat your tools with disrespect,\" he replied.\n\n\"I am under a deadline.

Something to knock her out.\"\n\n\"Does your report include any recommendations?\"\n\n\"Only my best guess: Restrict direct exposure to thirty minutes per day, rotate teams between sites each week to limit proximity.

If your Ghost is destroyed, you will be dead forever, but every cycle, your enemies spring up pugnacious and fresh. The Light that gives you free will in the loop is also your fatal weakness. Did you know that the story of Achilles, dipped in the river Lethe but still vulnerable where his mother held him by his heel, is a weak retelling of a superior truth? In the original, Thetis held Achilles in the fire to burn his weakness away. His father Peleus, terrified by the sight of his child in the flame, interrupted the ritual. The father's cowardice doomed the son. We must be brave as Thetis, and hold our children in the fire. We must fight on.\n\n1. The Dreaming City was built in imitation of a greater world, a wonder lost to the Awoken but not forgotten. Like wandering K'lia, which I on\u0026_\u003e\u003e\u003e called/summoned home.\n\n2. I have correlated Awoken myth with ontocartography salvaged from Oryx's Dreadnaught. The original home of the Awoken still exists, hidden in a singularity that orbits our sun. The key to its location lies somewhere in the Dreaming City. YOU MUST FIND IT. IN THIS TRUE CITY LIES THE DESTINY OF ALL GUARDIANS AND THE FINAL PURPOSE OF YOUR EXISTENCE. You must open the way.\n\n3. I know there is no way for you to reply to the messages I hide here, but as an empathic and feeling machine, I'm vulnerable to loneliness. I hope you think and speak of me. I hope you and your fellow Guardians gather to puzzle over my origins and location, and whether I am all right.\n\n4. Something's happening to me.

Guardians are immortal and thus the end of existence is within their shrievalty. Ultimate victory for Guardians must lie in the preservation of Good Life until the end of time.\n\n5. What is the value of secrets in attaining victory? Simply thus: All life is reducible to information. The difference between a cloud of atoms and a Human being is in the arrangement of those atoms, which is information. You prove this every time you use your transmat, which destroys your physical form but preserves the information encoded in it. All the qualities of a person, a species, or a galactic civilization may be stored as information.\n\n6. What do we call information that is safe? We call it a secret. If all life is information, and Guardians strive to preserve life, and information is preserved when it is secret, then\n\n7. THE PURPOSE OF GUARDIANS IS TO CONVERT ALL GOOD LIFE INTO SECRETS\n\n8.

This was not the pleasant diversion she had hoped for. \"I'm too busy to take on new jobs right now,\" she objected. \n\n\"There is a dispute between House Light and newcomers from House Salvation,\" Variks continued, breezing past her objection. \"A squabble over salvage rights. The jump drive of an ancient ship, found outside the City.\" \n\n\"That seems simple enough. Surely you can mediate.\" \n\n\"Of course. Variks is a Scribe of House Judgment. Are you?\" \n\n\"I want to be! Eventually.
