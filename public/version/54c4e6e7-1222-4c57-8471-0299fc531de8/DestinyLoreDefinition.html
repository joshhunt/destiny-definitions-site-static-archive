Mine is a prejudice shared by many: evolution's paintbrush cut within the Hive a terrible anatomy rendered to elicit fear; they are loathsome things to look upon, after all. I speak not as some superstitious provincial afraid of the dark, but as a Ghost well-versed in the language of suffering. \n\nLook at this one: they call him a Knight, this sin putrefying upon a slab. Is it only brute strength that qualifies a knighthood now? I have little compassion for the universe's mockery upon chivalric ideals.\n\nIn contrast, I call myself a creature of moral strength and sound reasoning, and as such, believe these traits allow me to judge so unforgivingly—but alas, I am also afflicted by a most curious and inquisitive nature. It is why, when my debased fellows departed to find unity with the Hive, I found myself compelled to witness their descent. \n\nNot to share in it, of course. I doubt we share anything more than a species and the dark urge we all undoubtedly feel.\n\nYet as I watched them, I could not deceive myself into denying the elegance of pouring the Light in all its multiplex glory into these avatars of terrible intricacy. It is a sinister geometry, but not without its beauty. Gazing on them with an eye unvarnished by niceties, one can see that a fiendish purity of purpose drives them. They spill confidence like a vintner drunk on his own reserves.\n\nSuch a shame that this purity and confidence was leveled at the unforgivable quintain striking at our great Traveler and unraveling its works.\n\nI shudder at the ease with which my comrades ignore such basic logic. This is the Hive! Disciples of that unholy church which laid our creator low. They struck for its heart and shattered a roaring conflagration into ten thousand motes flickering in the wind. In their fervor, they… played midwife, of a sort, to Guardians.\n\nTo Ghosts.\n\nTo me.\n\nCause and effect. Legacy. Is this what my fellow Ghosts see? Why it feels… right?

Naturally. He insisted on naming me Krill in our first exchange because he claims I am as small and useless as the weak pests that the Hive evolved from. Cruelty and suspicion are his nature, but it makes for a poor physician. \n\nStill, poison is a logical, if ignorant, hypothesis for the condition.\n\nPatients report various symptoms: mood swings, headache, insomnia. Primary symptom remains the growths. I hesitate to call them \"tumors\"—no signs of metastasization. One must be precise in terminology, after all.\n\n—-\n\nAfter some clumsy exploratory surgery on my inner workings, Ubartu-ana seems content I am not some Trojan horse. Wouldn't that be ironic? Ghosts sent to reclaim the Hive from death only to wipe them out by dispersing pathogenic specks rather than Light. \n\nAs I said: ignorant.\n\n—-\n\nBiopsied a dozen growths. No clear results.

No sign of infection, but curiously, the lining of these \"cysts,\" for lack of a better term, seems to be saturated with immune cells. Further biopsies will be needed.\n\n—-\n\nWondrous developments! Biopsy 37 yielded aggressive results. I pierced a cyst to discover not fluid, but life! A winged arthropod attacked me—defending its host, I estimate! Little of its body remained upon destruction, but it seems to be more energy construct than flesh. I plan to take the next specimen alive for vivisection.\n\n—-\n\nConfirmed: the winged arthropods, despite their energy structure, also contain Hive cells! I theorize Hive physiology, unaccustomed to Light exposure, is attempting to isolate it like an infection. Light, structured as it is, organizes the discarded sebum within and forges it into imaginal cells, kickstarting a sort of holometabolism.\n\nIncredible. The Hives' own bodies transform Light into a parasite! What a wondrous adaptation!\n\n—-\n\nThey are commending Ubartu-ana for \"his\" discovery.

Nabenki interviewed the primary suspect; Hive prefer talking to their own and don't respond to things—even things that bring them back from the dead.\n\nOverheard confession.

Three more deaths fitting same pattern: internal artifacts of Light, victims summarily executed. But circumstances raise more questions.

Suspects an organized smuggling ring, potential Human or Fallen infiltration.\n\nPLD018. 14:57. Encountered suspect Thrall; no identification, classified POI-7. Tests confirm traces of Light. Nabenki applied standard Hive interrogation techniques, extracted confession after extended session. POI-7 admitted to \"stealing\" Light, keeping it in urns. Also implicated a superior Acolyte. Doesn't add up.\n\nPLD018. 19:12. Requested time alone with suspect to establish rapport. Nabenki hesitant; doesn't like being spoken to unbidden but acquiesces.

When asked about unusual activity, reported that his symbiote feels sated without need for bloodshed or tithing.\n\nPLD018. 19:33. Consulted Nabenki for context regarding tithing. Apparently, Hive function on a system of energetic kickbacks, paid up the ladder, ending with queen. Would've been useful to know earlier.

Further, the resurrection of old personal memories creates vulnerability and distraction and has the potential to trigger long-lasting psychological detriment to the visitor. None of the possible applications are worth enough comparatively.\n\n4. Final thoughts—If there is any further value to be found here, it lies in the spaces between what VIP #7282 has created. Knowing that we see true memories does not mean there isn't a secondary agenda, and above all, we should ask: Why these memories in particular? What is it #7282 has to say to us, and what might the wide dissemination of these truths do? What do these truths say to you, IKO-006? \n\nI would prefer to avoid further deployment of this nature.\n\nMESSAGE ENDS","icon":"/common/destiny2_content/icons/fdd44a1d92f672d89041b4837fdb1b13.png"}},"935120008":{"hash":935120008,"index":1975,"redacted":false,"name":null,"iconImagePath":null,"colorImagePath":null,"displayProperties":{"name":"Personal Accountability","description":"ACCESS: PRIVATE\nDECRYPTION KEY: INVALID\nREP #: 005-LISBON \nAGENT(S): LIN-357\nSUBJ:  Personal Accountability\n\nI still can't accept this memory.

I moved forward with invocation of a personal item anyway, despite previous report concluding that it was unnecessary. Testing continued with the cloak I have kept from back then, the one I was wearing when I was found. I don't know what I was expecting from it—just that after all that time not remembering, my curiosity won out. I wanted to know.\n\n2. The memory was… like a key in a lock, all the rest laid open to me once I remembered this one thing.\n\nThe first time I witnessed the memory, I barely processed any of what was happening; I was so caught up in simply looking at her. I forgot to breathe. She had the most luminous blue eyes… how could I have ever forgotten her?\n\nEverything in my head was jumbled, all the things I'd forgotten were trying to be heard at once, and she was the only constant. So I used the item again, this time intending to make a coherent report, thinking I could process by writing it all down. I just wound up watching again, caught up in remembering the three of us. This awful set of moments, suspended in perfect replica. \n\nBefore this, I didn't recall anything of the incident, even who my fireteam was at the time. I'd wondered what might be in that gap, and why I hesitated even when I was curious. It wasn't enough to know that I had survived and should not return. I think, despite all that wondering, some part of me didn't want to remember. \n\nBut that's how lies happen, isn't it? In the places we don't want to look.

Logical next steps in analysis involve changing a variable in the known functional equation. I've taken the liberty of borrowing some items from others in order to conduct some tests regarding expectations—it is worth assessing how much influence the viewer has on the outcome.\n\n2. First test—Introduction of reasonably generic items. As expected, a chunk of Glimmer did nothing. A broken-off piece from the grip of a new sidearm, purchased specifically for this purpose—next to nothing. For a moment, there was a shadow, something that vaguely resembled the gunsmith at work or in conversation, but no memory replay as seen in the items known to produce memories of VIP #7282.\n\n3. Second test—I had an acquaintance borrow a trinket from a friend of theirs whom I have not met. The item is a medallion smaller than my palm, with old, rubbed-faint engravings. Following the introduction of this item to the Altar, a visible memory resulted, playing out in third person much like the other memories. I recorded details of this memory for reference and confirmation of accuracy. (Specifics omitted here as irrelevant.)\n\nOnce a recording had been made and committed, I accessed the file provided by the owner of the item. This file included summaries of what he thought were the most likely memories to be associated with the item. As you can see, details of what I observed matched one of those summaries. Owner's Ghost to provide additional context if necessary, either on my return or when another Hidden agent reaches out.\n\nWould like to recommend that another agent repeats the same test to see if they can view something different.\n\n4. While we had no reason to doubt the previously revealed memories, all this adds an additional layer of certainty: that which we can ascertain via the Altars is the truth, full and clear. The only remaining doubts are regarding why, and which memories. VIP #7282 is known to be cunning but has ultimately been truthful in previous dealings with the Vanguard. Regrettably, these things are not mutually exclusive. \n\n5. I had additional plans for analysis of the Altars involving personal items and memory, but I am reconsidering the wisdom in doing so, as well as the necessity. Beyond confirming that the memories produced are repeatable, true, and personal, do we need to know more? I will be moving on to the substance of the world next. \n\nMESSAGE ENDS","icon":"/common/destiny2_content/icons/fdd44a1d92f672d89041b4837fdb1b13.png"}},"935120012":{"hash":935120012,"index":1971,"redacted":false,"name":null,"iconImagePath":null,"colorImagePath":null,"displayProperties":{"name":"Altars of Reflection—Control","description":"ACCESS: RESTRICTED\nDECRYPTION KEY: QF4LYZX16G$IKO-006\nREP #: 218-HIVE-SAV\nAGENT(S): LIN-357\nSUBJ: Altars of Reflection—Control\n\n1. With the perimeter secured and all sensors ready for analysis, there is no immediate further obstacle to the initial experiments with Deepsight. On Vanguard authorization, I've borrowed one of the existing artifacts that has been used to produce and view VIP #7282's memories. Item: a shard of the crystal that #7282 used recently as a protective measure, cf. REP # 197-HIVE-SAV. \n\n2. In summary, following the known and established process, there is no deviation from what was previously reported. The memory of #7282's death and subsequent acquisition of Light played back as expected, identical in every beat. (See attached file for additional details as necessary.) This is not unexpected, and the recording, etc., have been made largely for archival purposes.\n\n3. Subsequent repetitions of the same process revealed additional words from #7282. Perhaps foolishly, I replied to portions of her dialogue that seemed to request a response. However, there was no explicit answer—I believe it is safe to conclude that there is no awareness of hers here, and what is heard is likely a recording coded to this specific memory and/or object. Her use of this method to influence and sow doubt is not unexpected.\n\n4. As a test, I used the crystal item to invoke Deepsight in the same fashion I used previously, this time with the intent of viewing something different—there are plentiful records of #7282's interactions with Vanguard and Reef personnel around the larger crystal this piece was retrieved from. However, none of these were viewable. The same item only allowed viewing of the same memory, suggesting a permanent association. I have some additional analysis planned to confirm this. \n\nAt first glance, these observations imply that if we wish to discover further memories, we will need to collect additional items, likely of personal relevance to #7282. (Confirmation of required item nature forthcoming.)\n\nMESSAGE ENDS","icon":"/common/destiny2_content/icons/fdd44a1d92f672d89041b4837fdb1b13.png"}},"935120013":{"hash":935120013,"index":1970,"redacted":false,"name":null,"iconImagePath":null,"colorImagePath":null,"displayProperties":{"name":"Altars of Reflection—Assessment","description":"ACCESS: RESTRICTED\nDECRYPTION KEY: QF4LYZX16G$IKO-006\nREP #: 217-HIVE-SAV\nAGENT(S): LIN-357\nSUBJ: Altars of Reflection—Assessment\n\n1. I arrived onsite and made my way into the Altar space. It doesn't appear to have changed much, if at all, from earlier provided telemetry. As predicted, there were barriers to access: several of the Lucent Brood obstructed my passage and were subsequently dispatched without much trouble. Additionally, the same complication as previously reported blocked the way—Hive runes. Parsing their nature and repetition of specific patterns was required to gain full access to the Altar. \n\n2. On the topic of the presented resistance: there were significantly fewer Hive defenders than could have been mustered, given intelligence on available forces. Based on the token nature of this resistance and the fact that VIP #7282 surely knows that Guardians have been here, it can be assumed that the defense is not a sincere attempt to keep us out. Historical precedent exists for setting a guard on a location or item to make it appear more attractive. \n\nPrecedent also exists for opening the way for Guardians to participate in the Hive sword logic. I do not yet have reason to believe this is taking place here, especially given the severance of #7282's connection to the Worm Gods that have otherwise led her species, but it does not pay to be incautious around the Hive.\n\n3. Once appropriate precautions were taken against any further incursions, I deployed sensors to record what data is possible, focusing on the central Altar and its exterior boundaries. Simultaneously, it was necessary to assess the available space for myself; impressions follow.\n\nIt is more aesthetically appealing than we usually associate with Hive—only the structures bear vague resemblance to those on Luna. The colors are pleasing, far removed from scarlet and rot, and the area lacks jagged edges or significant quantities of bone. Structurally, it is a space clearly built to highlight the central area, and indeed, it draws one to the Altar itself.\n\nAll told, in architecture alone, the creator demonstrates a clear evolution, presumably mirroring her own.\n\n4. On the topic of the structure: although the available space does not appear to have walls, there is a definite boundary. Matter grows foggy, and there is a strong sense of pushback when moving away from the center. Initially, I believed this to be a function of the architecture, but significant willpower was required to force myself to look further into testing the concept. That alone suggests it should be investigated more. \n\nConscious of the bias in doing so, I am marking it for later experimentation, as it would involve straying from the central objective. Further data forthcoming.\n\nMESSAGE ENDS","icon":"/common/destiny2_content/icons/fdd44a1d92f672d89041b4837fdb1b13.png"}},"935120014":{"hash":935120014,"index":1969,"redacted":false,"name":null,"iconImagePath":null,"colorImagePath":null,"displayProperties":{"name":"Altars of Reflection—Dispatch","description":"ACCESS: RESTRICTED\nDECRYPTION KEY: QF4LYZX16G$IKO-006\nREP #: 216-HIVE-SAV \nAGENT(S): LIN-357 \nSUBJ: Altars of Reflection—Dispatch\n\n1. Regarding the power known as Deepsight and its use within VIP #7282's throne world:\nSome Guardians have already used this power to access secret pockets of space. Hidden agents have dubbed them \"Altars of Reflection\" for now. There, the invocation of Deepsight in concert with significant objects has enabled us to view memories belonging to #7282.\n\n2. Access to this power requires spending time with the Relic, and subsequently, in one of the Pyramids. Long-term exposure to Darkness in this manner carries inherent risk, and the process is nontrivial. However, in the interest of learning everything possible about this space and the relevant VIP, certain chances must be taken.   \n\nConsidering the sensitive nature of the topic, reports should be directed subject to the attention of IKO-006 only. \n\n3. So far, it is estimated that Guardians have been able to view memories that #7282 wants. This supposition is upheld by #7282's specific and personal input on the memories in question. But why these memories? This remains a worthwhile question to answer in order to understand #7282's larger goal.\n\n4. Hidden agent (LIN-357) was dispatched in full understanding of requisite risks to determine the following as possible: limits and potential of physical space, applicability of other items and memories, span of #7282's attention to the mentioned spaces, possibility for use of Deepsight outside of Altar parameters, and possibility for use of Altar parameters with other applications.  \n\n5. LIN-357 is also to assess potential danger in continuing and encouraging Guardian access to and use of Altar spaces. \n\nMESSAGE ENDS","icon":"/common/destiny2_content/icons/fdd44a1d92f672d89041b4837fdb1b13.png"}},"940788946":{"hash":940788946,"index":1923,"redacted":false,"name":null,"iconImagePath":null,"colorImagePath":null,"displayProperties":{"name":"Star Jasmine","description":"TYPE: RECOVERED SENSOR LOGS \n\nPARTIES: Two [2] Human-type, designate Umiña, Osiris.

No, no automat for supper; no noodles. Tonight is something special: corn pone and chitlins. This here's history on a plate. Now, don't give me that look before you even taste it. If the world's fixing to end again, it's time you had a meal from our family's past while you hear about it. About how the Rigby clan survived the last time the world went dark.\n\nNow the Rigbys, we didn't always squat on the edge of the City. A long time back, we came out of a place that was old and wet, hotter than the fires of Perdition—so your Gramma's gramma and her pappy before her have said. It was also a place where the Devil roamed, giving folk their heart's desire.\n\nAnd I know that last part is true, because your ancestor—Sean Rigby was his name—he came to a crossroads one midnight, drunk and feeling the fool, and…  he saw her. Standing there, checking the time and looking cool as no other in the sweltering August heat. Tall as cottonwood in bloom and wearing a smile across her lips that stopped short of her eyes. Some say the Devil is a man with a pointy beard. Others say the Devil's a terrifying beast with claws and a tail. But Sean? He knew right then. The Devil was a lady.\n\nThe Devil bent down close to him, setting her eyes on his wayward soul. Her voice was honeysuckle-sweet as she said, \"I know you, Sean Rigby. I seen you sweat and sob for a scrap of land you can't even rightly say is your own. I seen your family fight to save a name that's more precious to you than gold. Well there is a reckoning coming, Sean Rigby, one that will wipe all lands and all names—high and low—clean from this Earth. I alone can whistle up the way to protect one of these things you hold dear, if your family will owe me… a debt.\"\n\nOld Sean was already a sinner, but a man with nothing will fight to keep what little he has. He figured that alive and in the Devil's pocket was better than dead, so he shook her hand. The Devil opened her eyes—one, two, three—and pointed him to the last star in the sky, far to the south. She said, \"That's your star, Sean Rigby. Follow it each night, when it's the last star hanging low, and sing to it. You sing, 'Al Eck Ruk Nam, Shu Nam Eck Ur,' until you call that star down to Earth. You do that, and your family will endure.\" \n\nThe Rigbys did as they were told and walked south. Each night they sang, and each night their star sat lower and lower. And when it finally fell, they were safe beneath the Traveler.\nBut now, children, I give you the same dire warning that's been handed down to me: the Devil hasn't come back yet to take what's hers… not from Sean, or any other Rigby what survived him. But a debt's a debt.

She promises to sacrifice his Light to a vessel in the Hellmouth. He feigns begging. The Wizard cackles with delight and lets slip her commander's name on the Moon. Crow thanks her with a well-placed Solar blade. Glint materializes as Crow calls the Accipiter.\n\n\"I know it's not what Saladin would do.\"\n \nCrow winces as Glint stitches the gushing split in his neck with Light-thread restoration. \n\n\"The Hive need to think they're winning,\" Crow says through gritted teeth. \n\nThey monologue, like their words are torture; reveal tiny scraps as they mock him, when they think he's done for. And he lets them. He collects the grains of truth and turns them into something useful. \n\nMOON-224120\n\nCrow stares down over thirty Hive emerging from the gaping Hellmouth. Two Lightbearing Knights lead them. They shriek and posture over the corpse of a freshly drained Guardian.\n\n\"You should go,\" Crow says to Glint, removing his helmet. He sets it on the stone at his feet. The thin Moon air is coarse with particulate. He dashes toward the gnashing swarm.\n\n\"At least put your helmet back on!\" Glint calls after him meekly. \"…I'll get help!\"\n\nSolar Light flows through Crow. \"Come on! YOU WANT ME? I'M HERE!\" \n\nHand flexes around the grip of his cannon; flames sputter from fingertips across cylinder—a series of firebolts crack from Crow's freshly kindled Golden Gun. He unloads as many rounds as he can before the Hive close the distance to him. It's enough to incinerate the Knight and their Ghost, but not the army of Thrall still rushing him down. Crow primes a Tripmine Grenade as the churn of Thrall claws tear him apart.\n\n*****\n\nCrow opens his eyes. Glint floats over him beside a strange woman. \n\n\"That was a wasteful life, Prince of the Reef,\" she says disapprovingly.\n\n\"Don't call me that.\" He sits up in a hanging trail of moondust, realizing she likely dragged his body from the Hellmouth.\n\n\"He's not a fan of nicknames,\" Glint whispers to her.\n\n\"Very well. I'm Eris Morn, a friend,\" the woman croons with an outstretched hand.\n\n\"Right.\" Crow takes her hand and stands. \"Makes sense… with the…\" Crow gestures to his eyes, but Eris doesn't seem to react. He coughs awkwardly. \"Uh, Ikora mentioned you… being on Europa, and Mars, I think.\"\n\n\"The Hive move against Earth. Something approaches, and I am deciphering its course. Though regarding Savathûn's plots and the whims of queens, I imagine our motivations are not dissimilar.\"\n\nCrow sighs. \"Well, I'm done being strung along by people with plans.\"\n\n\"The powerful have plans for us all. It's better to see them laid out before you,\" Eris offers.\n\nCrow glares at his Ghost. \"Hm. Sounds like someone's been sharing again…\"\n\n\"I knew you, and I know of you.\" Eris grips the scales of his sleeve and pulls him uncomfortably close. \"Your memories will be lessons in time, when you've burned out your vengeance and self-pity.

It exists within each life, an expanse and myriad of complexity explored openly through the philosophical constructs of choice and free will. Even when life ends, possibility carries forward in the lives touched and the projects created. When the actions of another end a life, Humans often refer to this act as killing or \"taking a life.\" But where killing brings about a singular conclusion, Oryx's \"Taking\" was quite the opposite: he imposed a singular origin and all decisions that followed. He shaped the causality, the very history of another being, by force of will—recasting it into fanatical loyalty. In short, possibility never existed.\n\nLike Ikora, my role is anticipating threats. While these Taken and their king may have been the most dangerous opponents we have ever faced, they likely will be the least of what is yet to come. And Taking has terrible potential if wielded by a mind more nuanced than Oryx's. Taking involves reforming matter in a self-contained reality, where the creator defines past, present, and future; imagine how a more insightful being could expand these definitions, to different ends. Overcoming a target's will must consume a large portion of energy. What if you used that energy for larger shifts in reality? You could teleport an army into a Hive mothership… move a fleet outside time and space… perhaps even alter a moon's orbit, devastating the planet below. The military applications could be far graver than simply creating an army.\n\nClearly, this is a subject in dire need of study. As the Taken themselves are frustratingly ephemeral, I have instead retrieved a variety of osmium ore samples from Oryx's flagship. They resonate in harmony with the Taken and thus may provide guidance in understanding the profane science behind them.\n\n—Personal Logs, Ophiuchus","icon":null}},"3300312357":{"hash":3300312357,"index":1900,"redacted":false,"name":null,"iconImagePath":null,"colorImagePath":null,"displayProperties":{"name":"Resonant Fury Robes","description":"Conquest.
