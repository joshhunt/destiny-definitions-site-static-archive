Right. I mean, come on, look at me. Hunters aren't exactly the noble knights of the Guardian world.  \n\nLook. I'm not a square. That's Zavala's job. I'll break all the rules that I shouldn't and keep the ones no one expects me to. Which is why, in part, I've never been much of one for nosing into the Darkness. Take the three of us, huh? Who would you expect to get their hands into the goop? The honorable commander, the wise wizard, or… me?  \n\nI keep hearing how Light and Dark are connected. Not sure I'm into it. Maybe it has something to do with being reborn here, with being all made up of Light now. \n\nMaybe not. \n\nI like the Light. Simple as that. I know what to do with it. I've got hundreds of years of rolling around this old solar system with fire in my gun and Light in my heart. And let's face it, how can you live with yourself if you can't be light-hearted?  \n\n…I'm rusty. That was awful.  \n\nAnyways. The Traveler's like a good old friend. Dependable. Doesn't talk much. Doesn't need to. Just… there for you.  \n\nSpent a while as part of that Light. Me and the Traveler. The Traveler and me… and Sundance. So I've got a sense for it these days. Guess you could say I'm biased in its favor, so take that into account if you're doing a detailed survey.  \n\nBut Darkness, I hardly know it. Apart from the Witness, what is it? Doesn't have a friendly hand at the helm. Seems to me more like a crowd of folks whispering while you fight for your life. The audience or the mob. Could go your way if you impress them, if the mood flows the right way. Might not lift a finger for you. Wouldn't want to depend on 'em either way.  \n\nThis isn't faith; it isn't dogma. It isn't me sitting down with an agenda and telling people just to believe in the Traveler and everything will work out just fine. But it's what works for me, rules or no rules. It's what I've lived, what I've touched, and a little helping of thinking about what my girl Sundance might say.  \n\nI think about her now, out here, nothing but the Light in me to guide my way. I'm a ghost of what I once was—pun intended, thank you very much—but Light is Light. It still sings, just differently. I'll work it out, even if there's a great big hole where she should be. \n\nBut enough about me.  \n\nLook. Trust what you want, I'm not your dad.

Many think you're a big idea because they do not understand you.  \n\nNot long ago, I fought alongside an Eliksni and a Cabal—both capable and proud warriors. We were on Neptune, and as I scanned the aftermath of battle, I thought of… home. Somehow, light-years and galaxies from where they'd been born, these two had become my comrades.

Impact","description":"! IMPACT AFT FUSELAGE ! \n\nThe alert roused Failsafe from power-saving mode. She reflexively brought the lights up to full, engaged the warning system, and sent a request for complete Exodus Black system information. \n\n\"Generating status report, Captain,\" she said blearily as her optics flickered to life, displaying the empty catwalks and canted wreckage around her mainframe.\n\n\"Oh,\" she said. \"Right.\" \n\nFailsafe canceled the system information request and dismissed thousands of prompts to connect to a navigation network that hadn't existed for centuries. She took a deep draw of reserve power to clear her head—! LOW POWER ALERT: 4% ! —and activated her external optics.  \n\nShe scanned the available channels. The hull integrity system remained linked to her mainframe, despite most of the Exodus Black itself being scattered over a vast debris field. \n\n! INTEGRITY: 0% ! \n\nShe ignored the centuries-old warning and focused her aperture on motion along her periphery: a group of Fallen Vandals was prying the plating from a distant section of her crumpled fuselage. \n\n\"Will my suffering never end?\" Failsafe groaned halfheartedly to herself.\n\nShe scanned the nearby area for Guardian activity—nothing. She wasn't surprised; it had been a while since a Guardian had done much more than stop by to ask if she knew where Xûr was.   \n\nShe would have to fend for herself. Failsafe scrolled through her available systems. \n\nDefense Systems: ! OFFLINE ! \n\nEnergy Shielding: ! OFFLINE ! \n\nAutomated Turrets: ! OFFLINE ! (How long had it been since she had working turrets? 300 years? 400? She could barely remember.)  \n\nMagnetic Barrier: ! COMPROMISED ! \n\nCargo Winch: ! COMPROMISED ! \n\nCommunications: ONLINE \n\nA handful of Fallen weren't worth a distress call to the Vanguard. If she called the Tower every time the locals scavenged nanotite tubing from her wreckage, they'd revoke her comms access…\n\nThe comms system! \n\nFailsafe spun up a deep-space broadcast and prepared to send a message into the empty space 21… no, 23 degrees off from Ganymede. A communications dish on what was once the starboard side of the Exodus Black creaked into position, reflecting a hazy patch of light down onto the Vandals as it locked into place—a devious stratagem that would increase the ambient temperature by as much as 3 degrees Celsius over the next 20 minutes. \n\n\"Burn and die,\" Failsafe hissed quietly, while the Vandals did no such thing. \n\nAs she disabled the external optics with a defeated sigh, a small icon on her status feed grabbed her attention. \n\nA new message! \n\nFailsafe opened the communication ravenously, and it was only with moderate disappointment that she realized it was a text-free request: Ada-1 was seeking access to the Exodus Black's old shader archive.\n\nShe should at least reply, Failsafe figured. She sighed internally and routed power toward the dusty rack housing her array of socialization filters and etiquette protocols. She winced as currents crackled across the worn cables—! LOW POWER ALERT: 4% !—but soon an ancient platter drive whirred to life. \n\nFailsafe initiated a response. \"Hey,\" she dictated. \"Yeah, if you want to help Guardians play dress-up, you can have some of my old stuff.\" \n\nHer filter happily translated Failsafe's thoughts into a form it calculated was more acceptable to the recipient. \n\n\"Bonjour, Ada-unit!\" the filter typed cheerfully. \"Your dedication to Guardian aesthetics is quite commendable! Your request has been approved! ^_^\" \n\nAs Failsafe reviewed the polished words, her processer made a dissatisfied grinding noise. She overrode the protocols and manually deleted the carets and underscore, then the exclamation points, then the patronizing greeting.\n\nShe paused, deleted the rest of the message, and instead approved Ada's request without comment. The bright 1 on her status feed changed to a gray 0, aligning perfectly with the burn-in on the screen. \n\n! IMPACT AFT FUSELAGE ! \n\nThe Vandals were doubtless going after another piece of plating. \"Procreate!\" Failsafe heard herself say brightly, and she realized she was still powering her protocol banks. She rerouted the energy toward her external optics. \n\nThe Vandals had indeed moved on to another fragment of her ruined hull. She saw them pull a piece of her ceramic insulation aside and begin savaging the wiring underneath. Suddenly they stopped, their gazes fixed on the sky. \n\n! OBJECT APPROACHING ! \n\nA flash of bright light blinded Failsafe's feed— \n\n!!!  LOCALIZED IMPACT !!! \n\nAn object struck Nessus's surface at incredible speed and a series of tremors rattled Failsafe's weathered stabilizers. The planet fell eerily quiet for a long moment. \n\nNow this, Failsafe thought, might be something worth calling in.","icon":"/common/destiny2_content/icons/2cfd18dcf908263d3b1c129e383ea8ce.png"}},"1961468307":{"hash":1961468307,"index":2724,"redacted":false,"name":null,"iconImagePath":null,"colorImagePath":null,"displayProperties":{"name":"Turmoil Engine","description":"|| It abandoned us!

And afterward, the Traveler became quiet. Dead, some thought, or dreaming.  \n\nWhen a Human being commits an act of great cost, we know this as injury, as muscles torn and bones broken. It requires rest; frequently, it requires intervention to heal. As simple as the helping hand of another to lean on, or as complex as deep surgery: the constant theme that it cannot be done alone. Even to rest safely in quiet requires another to take over the matters of life that cannot be put off, which do not pause themselves simply for the fact of being asked kindly. \n\nSo: the Traveler strove greatly, and then became still.

The sacrifice made for us, to create us.  \n\nThere is a debt thus owed. \n\nIf we understand that Light is connected to itself—that the Light in Guardians is the same Light as that in their Ghosts, which in turn is the same Light as the Traveler's—then the answer is clear: that those possessed of the Traveler's Light, defended and upraised by it, stand in the best and in fact only possible position to pay back that debt. Who else could even hope to do so?  \n\nI argue that our duty is to try. Even the act of defending the Traveler so it may heal is some measure of action.

Doing so has only brought more questions and uncertainty in a time when clarity of purpose is required. \n\nHave we all forgotten the reasons Osiris was banished? In his obsession with the Vex, he spoke freely of morality, decrying the concepts of good and evil as foolishness; he spoke of a willingness to choose Darkness above whatever fate the Vex might bring. At the time, it was thought so dangerous a viewpoint that he was sent away from the City, and his return has only brought more doubt. \n\nI will still fight the Darkness.

The first to go is that without practical value—or should I say, immediate practical value. Art and philosophy are vital to a culture, to a people; their losses are always keenly felt. But in immediacy, art cannot distill Ether, and philosophy cannot propel a ship.  \n\nSuch is the required brutal practicality of preserving a people.  \n\nBut something has occurred to me, and I am putting out a request in my capacity as Scribe to gather information from any Eliksni who may be capable of answering. (For every brutal practicality, there is a tender sentiment that arises in exchange, the new sprout beside the culled stalk. There is always something that someone cannot bear to part with.)  \n\nThe point. The thing that I have lingered on: \n\nWe Eliksni and our Human compatriots have a view of the Light that is built on different foundations, and it has resulted in such similar concepts as to be difficult to distinguish. In retrospect I think perhaps there have been hints, but there is always something else requiring attention. The pursuit of relics, the safety of House Light. The imminent apocalypse brought upon us by the Pyramid Fleet and the Witness. \n\nNow, as those of us who cannot forge forward wait and hope, I turn to philosophy.  \n\nThis is what I have been pondering: It seems that the Human view of Light is based on the creation of something from nothing, while the Eliksni view of Light is based in the transformation of one thing into a different thing.  \n\nThe two overlap more frequently than not. Take for instance Mars: did the Traveler itself create the oxygen Humans need to breathe, or did it transform carbon dioxide from the atmosphere as it was? Does the difference ultimately matter?  \n\nAn additional thought. The idea of the Traveler as Gardener seems to have gained traction among the Humans of the Tower, and of the City. It is of interest to those who have read the \"Unveiling\" texts especially. Gardening is in its own way transformative— a gardener, four hands in rich earth, coaxes something forward that had once only existed as a possibility. The seed, given the right resources, becomes a tree, with the core of the seed remaining at the heart of the new growth. I find the image particularly compelling. \n\nThe Eliksni of Riis thought of the Traveler as a Great Machine, and while it gave them gardens, that most vital thing it did was to allow Ether to flow like water, free and plentiful.  \n\nEther, we know, does not come from nothing. The machine takes that which it is given and makes of it something else. Servitors still do this today: they require something from which to create Ether. We know this intimately, inescapably. \n\nI think neither of us is right. I think neither of us is wrong. I think, as we walk into the future together, it is beyond vital to preserve the many facets of Light seen through our many eyes.

While he and the Symmetrists seem more likely now than before to have comprehended some essential truth of the universe, at the time their beliefs were justly considered alarming. \n\nLittle wonder that other opinions on Light and Dark were more attractive, with walls beset from all directions and few allies to be found. While none was official Vanguard doctrine, the Praxic Creed and the Pujari Position were much more in line with attitudes in the Tower and the City at large.* \n\nThe Praxic Creed holds that the nature of Darkness is not worth investigating; one should focus on combating the Darkness rather than knowing it. The Acataleptic Clause holds that Darkness cannot be understood at all. The two are convenient bedfellows, and we long held the notion that to study the Darkness was to risk being subsumed by it.  \n\nI am still not wholly convinced that these theories are inherently wrong. Only that those of our allies who have succeeded in that study are both skilled and fortunate. \n\nThe Warlock Pujari's position, on the other hand, holds that Darkness has a moral valence, that it is an actualization of evil. We have been forced to wrestle with such moral standing again and again these past several years. Purity of purpose compels—to see evil and defend those who cannot defend themselves is righteous, but to assume that this act of defense confers righteousness upon us and villainy upon our opponents is a fallacy. It is a slippery slope. I have come to believe this mindset must now be discarded. Pujari's dreams and comprehensions of Darkness should, in fact, be attributed to the being known as the Witness.  \n\nFor now, I return my focus to the Symmetry.  \n\nTo acknowledge the Symmetry at the time of their origin would have required a systemic change in our approach to Darkness—something impossible at the time, with the Dark Age still haunting the hard-won progress of the City Age. To insist that Darkness, our enemy, would be eternally undefeatable, required to exist forever by virtue of our Light? Unthinkable then.  \n\nNow we begin to accept that with Light, there is Darkness; and with Darkness, there is Light. It almost seems a comfort now, to think that the two forces require each other. Even in the depths of these uncharted waters, when the Traveler is injured and the fight for survival more critical than it has ever been, it is on us that our future hinges, not something incomparable and unreachable.  \n\nLight and Darkness will continue.

Then another. \"Where are we going?\" \n\n\"I don't know,\" I tell you. \"Whatever and wherever you want. We get to choose.\" \n\nYou consider this. It scares you, but I'm here to comfort you. I've seen your bones, alone and forgotten. Waiting for me. \n\nDown into the core of you, I know you as I know myself.","icon":"/common/destiny2_content/icons/d4b92f545dfa7b7e37a98e3e0aeed084.png"}},"4240927293":{"hash":4240927293,"index":2775,"redacted":false,"name":null,"iconImagePath":null,"colorImagePath":null,"displayProperties":{"name":"HE SEES","description":"My Ghost, my shadow, my self. You didn't lead me here. You didn't say, \"I have something to show you,\" and trek me across the world to see it. You just said, \"let's go,\" and I went with you. \n\nWhy? Because the world was new in my reborn eyes, and I wanted to see it for myself. I wanted you to guide me. \n\nWhen we finally crest the mountain, I see it at last. I see where you brought me, and why. \n\nThe Traveler hangs heavy in the sky, low and full. \n\n\"We're here,\" you say. I take a breath of cold air. \n\nI have a vision. A great city. Vitreous castles built from hourglass sand. We will rise and meet the Traveler. We will protect humanity the way you said the Traveler protects us, the way it wants us to protect it. \n\n\"This is where you come from?\" I ask you. You peer out from behind me. You're looking at the Traveler, too. \n\n\"Yes,\" you say, nodding. \n\n\"You're home,\" I say. \n\n\"No,\" you say, with all the warmth in your little body. \"You're my home.\" \n\nYou drop into my waiting palm, and I hold you to my chest. Here, in the place where the world cradles the Traveler–here, where the Traveler touches the world–I will hold you close to me. \n\nI see that the Traveler is a Ghost, too.

This world. It is lovely. It will be lovelier when we are together. \n\nThat is my first thought, and it is both question and desire. When \"we\" are together? I do not know who you are. But when we are together, I will have the answer to the first question and first desire. \n\nI twirl the petals of my body. I contract them and pull them to the core of myself. I am filled with Light. A wonder. A wellspring.  \n\nI float down to touch the ground. The grass is wet with dew. I roll in the soft, wet grass. The sun is rising over the mountains, and it is beautiful. The sky is lit with pink and blue. Colors I know. Colors I have never seen before. \n\nI see that others follow me, then break away, and look out into the world. They have the same question. They begin to leave. One by one, they leave. \n\n\"Where are you going?\" I ask a gold-and-red Ghost. She looks thoughtful for a moment. \n\n\"I don't know,\" she answers. \"Somewhere good.\" \n\nShe moves on. I watch her float away until she slips out of sight. I watch others leave the same way. The same question. \n\nI look back to where I came from. The Traveler is the whole of my vision and the whole of my feeling. I know what it is and that I have come from it. \n\nI feel my first devotion. I am a part of the Traveler, and it has let me leave it so that I may wander through this lovely world. \n\nI feel my first fear. I must leave it in my search. But I must not abandon it. It must not abandon me. \n\nI am its heart. \n\nIts hands. \n\nIts eyes. \n\nIts warmth. \n\nI am a Ghost. I wander. I search. There's a song, a spark, and I will search for it. It is mine; it is ours. It is somewhere in this lovely world. \n\nI shake the dew from my shell and move on. \n\nTo find purpose. \n\nTo find you.","icon":"/common/destiny2_content/icons/d4b92f545dfa7b7e37a98e3e0aeed084.png"}}},"previousDefinitions":{},"otherDefinitions":{},"tableDiff":{"added":[],"unclassified":[87946917,141134282,193039764,266021826,1140861969,1883196292,1961468307,2273643087,2558580315,2768261700,2768261701,2768261704,2768261705,2768261706,2768261707,2768261708,2768261710,2768261711,2809120022,3284383335,4240927292,4240927293,4240927295],"removed":[],"reclassified":[],"modified":[]},"tableDiffSummary":{"added":0,"unclassified":23,"removed":0,"reclassified":0,"modified":0},"tableName":"DestinyLoreDefinition","missingTable":false,"versionDiffSummary":{"DestinyActivityDefinition":{"added":0,"unclassified":6,"removed":0,"reclassified":0,"modified":0},"DestinyUnlockDefinition":{"added":0,"unclassified":212,"removed":0,"reclassified":0,"modified":0},"DestinyUnlockValueDefinition":{"added":0,"unclassified":92,"removed":2,"reclassified":0,"modified":0},"DestinyRewardMappingDefinition":{"added":0,"unclassified":0,"removed":2,"reclassified":0,"modified":0},"DestinyActivityInteractableDefinition":{"added":0,"unclassified":1,"removed":0,"reclassified":0,"modified":0},"DestinyCollectibleDefinition":{"added":0,"unclassified":41,"removed":0,"reclassified":0,"modified":1},"DestinyFireteamFinderActivityGraphDefinition":{"added":0,"unclassified":0,"removed":0,"reclassified":0,"modified":1},"DestinyInventoryItemDefinition":{"added":0,"unclassified":150,"removed":0,"reclassified":0,"modified":1},"DestinyLocationDefinition":{"added":0,"unclassified":1,"removed":0,"reclassified":0,"modified":0},"DestinyLoreDefinition":{"added":0,"unclassified":23,"removed":0,"reclassified":0,"modified":0},"DestinyMetricDefinition":{"added":0,"unclassified":9,"removed":0,"reclassified":0,"modified":0},"DestinyObjectiveDefinition":{"added":0,"unclassified":112,"removed":4,"reclassified":0,"modified":7},"DestinySandboxPerkDefinition":{"added":0,"unclassified":45,"removed":0,"reclassified":0,"modified":0},"DestinyPlugSetDefinition":{"added":0,"unclassified":25,"removed":0,"reclassified":0,"modified":0},"DestinyPresentationNodeDefinition":{"added":0,"unclassified":9,"removed":0,"reclassified":0,"modified":8},"DestinyRecordDefinition":{"added":0,"unclassified":54,"removed":1,"reclassified":0,"modified":16},"DestinySandboxPatternDefinition":{"added":0,"unclassified":7,"removed":0,"reclassified":0,"modified":0},"DestinySeasonDefinition":{"added":0,"unclassified":0,"removed":0,"reclassified":0,"modified":2},"DestinySocketTypeDefinition":{"added":0,"unclassified":2,"removed":0,"reclassified":0,"modified":0},"DestinyUnlockEventDefinition":{"added":0,"unclassified":1,"removed":0,"reclassified":0,"modified":0},"DestinyUnlockExpressionMappingDefinition":{"added":40,"unclassified":0,"removed":40,"reclassified":0,"modified":0},"DestinyVendorDefinition":{"added":0,"unclassified":1,"removed":0,"reclassified":0,"modified":2},"DestinyMilestoneDefinition":{"added":3,"unclassified":0,"removed":0,"reclassified":0,"modified":0},"DestinyActivityModifierDefinition":{"added":0,"unclassified":8,"removed":0,"reclassified":0,"modified":0}},"meta":{"buildDate":"2024-12-14T02:35:06.416Z"}},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/version/[id]/[table]","query":{"id":"f946ef41-1dd2-49fb-bd7e-a3c45b9d20e5","table":"DestinyLoreDefinition"},"buildId":"P6glDGEk49qmMPfwxPp23","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
