It's impossible to engage with the concept without falling into the web of cunning devised by the Witch Queen, even after her death.\n\nIt's elegant. And irritating.\n\nWe are familiar with the sword logic: the need to endure and force the universe to endure you. It's a contest. When there is nothing left standing but you, then you've won. Your prize is existence.\n\nBut imbaru is tribute from the failure to understand. When Savathûn ensnared us with her cunning, she fed her worm. Every false step or mistake in our attempts to unravel Savathûn's plans gave her exactly what she wanted. Whenever someone believed a lie or doubted a truth, she became that much more powerful.\n\nWe might think we know what we're doing here, but in many ways, I doubt we do.

They were perhaps the most delicious thing Ikora had tasted in the last 20 years. And while the two of them worked their way through the jar, Mithrax uncomfortably stumbled his way to his question.\n\n\"Eris Morn has changed,\" he said carefully, and Ikora nodded. \"She chose to change, and she acted out of… is there a Human word for 'love-bravery'?\"\n\nIkora smiled. \"Love,\" she said.\n\n\"Love, then,\" Mithrax nodded. \"If she were to change forever, if she cannot return to herself, will she be remembered well?

I am always impressed with the resilience of the Guardians, with or without their Light. Saint tells me the Titan Sloane embraced the Taken, and she is doing well.\"\n\n\"Yes, and for that, I am grateful,\" Ikora said. \"But… they don't always come back, Mithrax. An old friend of mine was corrupted by the Vex in a similar way. He stayed behind when the Pyramids attacked, just like Sloane. But I believe we lost him.\"\n\n\"I am sorry about your friend,\" Mithrax said somberly. \"I hope he is remembered as a hero.\"\n\nIkora raised her eyebrows but said nothing.\n\n\"I, too, encountered a great mind consumed by the Vex,\" Mithrax continued. \"The Guardian and I attempted a rescue, but it went deeper into the network as it gained the access it sought. It taught me that the pursuit of truth is worth any price—even one's own sense of self.\"\n\nIkora smiled. \"Asher would have agreed with every word of that.\"\n\nMithrax leaned forward in amazement, a leech dangling limply from his claws. \"You knew Ashermere?\"\n\nIkora cocked her head. \"Yes, Asher Mir. How on earth did you know him?\"\n\n\"Asher… Mir,\" Mithrax said slowly to himself, mimicking Ikora. \"That is why I have been unable to locate any records.\"\n\n\"Ikora,\" he said, straightening himself in his seat, \"I must tell you a story about our friend, Asher Mir, the hero.\"","icon":null}},"409337865":{"hash":409337865,"index":2510,"redacted":false,"name":null,"iconImagePath":null,"colorImagePath":null,"displayProperties":{"name":"Acroamatis","description":"Ikora took a deep breath to compose herself—she had been dreading the conversation she was about to initiate. She ran through all the anticipated objections and corresponding de-escalation tactics in her mind. It was important to keep the situation in-hand, at any cost. \n\nOnce she had steeled herself, she nodded to her Ghost, Ophiuchus, who engaged the holoprojector. A moment later, the bust of Empress Caiatl illuminated Ikora's office. Even translucent and digitized, the empress was an imposing figure. \n\nWith a steady voice and unwavering gaze, Ikora detailed the Vanguard's plan to resurrect Savathûn in exchange for the knowledge of how to breach the Witness's portal. Once she finished, Ikora braced for the empress's fury. Instead, she was met with pensive silence. \n\nWhen Caiatl finally spoke, her tone was measured. \"There was a time, not so long ago, when the Witch Queen's resurrection would have seemed like… a betrayal.\" \n\nIkora held her breath. \n\n\"But after working with Eris aboard the Leviathan… after speaking with Ghaul…\" The empress lowered and shook her tusks—a gesture of uncertainty. \"I must accept that the ways of Light and Dark are beyond my reckoning.\" \n\nCaiatl raised her tusks once again and hardened her voice. \"I trust Eris Morn as I would my own mythkeeper. If the Vanguard agrees that this is the only way to stop the Witness… then so be it. My legions will not stand in your way.\" \n\n\"My thanks, Empress,\" Ikora replied, with obvious relief. \n\n\"Besides,\" the empress concluded, \"if this plan brings me one step closer to crushing Xivu Arath's skull, then it has my blessing.\"","icon":null}},"523074950":{"hash":523074950,"index":2492,"redacted":false,"name":null,"iconImagePath":null,"colorImagePath":null,"displayProperties":{"name":"Veiled Tithes Mask","description":"Eris had whittled the Hive Knight's denuded femur into a shaft and driven it deep with osmium nails. She'd wrapped it in velvet string, attached her sigil to it. Now it chimed as she turned it in her hands.\n\n\"Yeah, make it pretty,\" Immaru said, rolling his eye. \"That'll help. Real useful.\"\n\n\"I am binding the staff with my power,\" she said archly. \"What 'use' have you been?\"\n\n\"I told you what to do!\"\n\n\"I gathered the materials. I crafted the staff. I infused it with Light and soulfire. Do not presume your ideas were essential to this process.\"\n\n\"You think you're such an expert in Hive magic,\" Immaru scoffed, \"but you know what? You're just doing parlor tricks. Without me, that staff would be nothin' more than a fancy piece of bone.\"\n\nEris gripped the staff and held it out to test its heft. It was unbalanced. She returned it to the worktable.\n\n\"Do not make yourself intolerable.\"\n\nImmaru moved so he could look Eris in the face. She raised her eyes, staring him down. He came close; she did not step back.\n\n\"Or what? You might scare everyone else, but you don't scare me. There's nothin' you can do except put up with me.\"\n\nEris returned to her work, raising a hand and pushing him out of the way. He huffed, watching her as she resumed sharpening the points of the staff's base.\n\n\"With this, the Guardian may devise rituals of their own. It will empower their Light and channel the Hive's vile power.\"\n\n\"You're welcome,\" Immaru said smugly.\n\nEris ignored him and examined the staff she had crafted. It represented hours spent sliding a blade's edge over layers of dead, porous Hive chitin, carving it with spells and imbuing it with magic. At its head was soulfire ichor, encased in vitreous Light. A gleaming vessel.\n\n\"One last reagent.\"\n\nShe turned back to her worktable.

The furtive gesture made him uneasy, but he couldn't risk anyone coming in. The feed he was about to watch could easily be misconstrued.  \n\nAs it was, the City smoldered with rumors from citizens and Guardians alike. The persistent, undulating hole in the Traveler's side put everyone on edge. Hearing that Vanguard leadership was using Hive magic to fulfil a bargain put forth by the Witch Queen would undoubtedly stoke the flames of panic. \n\nZavala leaned grimly over his desk to watch the Guardian's latest tithes to Eris Morn.  \n\nIt used to be simple, he lamented. We exterminated the Hive wherever we found them, and we felt good about it. Justified. But in recent years, morally ambiguous situations like these had become more common, and separating friend from foe was increasingly difficult. \n\nOver the feed, Eris Morn's face lit up with fierce elation as the Guardian's tithes flowed through her. Her Hive form seemed to swell with power. Zavala knew that Eris undertook the rituals with temperance, at least for now, but he wondered how long her clarity would last. Elsie Bray's warnings had been too vivid to dismiss entirely, even after Ikora's reassurances. \n\nZavala turned away from the feed to gaze out the window at the Traveler. The trauma puncturing its side reminded him of the stakes. The reasons they were taking such risks. \n\nHe sighed, wondering how many more compromises they would have to make before the end.","icon":null}},"601741876":{"hash":601741876,"index":2508,"redacted":false,"name":null,"iconImagePath":null,"colorImagePath":null,"displayProperties":{"name":"Pharmakos Shell","description":"A little flock of unpaired Ghosts shivered and murmured together in their luminous cage.

As Eris has explained to me, each rune is a logogram that encompasses many, and at times, contradictory meanings.  Curiously, some denote the particular Light energies used by Guardians and predate the acquisition of the Light by Savathûn's brood.\n\nThe style employed in inscribing the runes is unique to their practitioner. For instance, the runes that Eris writes follow concentric circles, while Savathûn composes long, tangential strings of runes. Runes also adorn many Hive weapons in long columns.\n\nI understand that Eris is now devising a ritual that requires the composition and empowerment of many Hive runes. I must remember to wish her luck.","icon":null}},"2953343703":{"hash":2953343703,"index":2496,"redacted":false,"name":null,"iconImagePath":null,"colorImagePath":null,"displayProperties":{"name":"Veiled Tithes Plate","description":"Mithrax had come to Ikora's office with a gift and a question. \n\nThe gift was a large glass jar of preserved leechlike creatures, oily and glistening.

Upon their first true deaths, they did not know what they had made. With their strength and the power of their worms, they created something dire, and found themselves there upon their deaths. Imagine the Hive gods' first glimpses of their realms. To retreat to one's throne is to retreat into the variances of one's mind. It is a stark confrontation.\n\nYou were well prepared for yours.
