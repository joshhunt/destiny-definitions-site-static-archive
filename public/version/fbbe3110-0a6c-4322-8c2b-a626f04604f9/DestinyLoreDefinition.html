A mixture of pride and fearful anxiety knotted her stomach, as if the interior of her skin was being tugged into her gut by warm sinew strings. She held the shape of her smile until they had taken their positions within the Blind Well. Austyn, Ylaia, and Sjari formed the core of the party, with the others interlinking in an exterior circle. They situated themselves at key points around a thrumming Wayfinder's Compass that bent the air into wild chromatic slurries. The Well awakened.\n\nThey prepared their minds. Slipped into meditation. Communion in searching. Thirteen voices spoke as one, and then silence as the Well dropped into prisms of glass beneath the novice Coven's feet. Not but a moment ago, they thirteen stood within the Blind Well, hands and minds interlocked. Now they cascaded through a river of possibility, will, and intention.\n\nIt was not long before the connection was made. Queen Mara Sov's voice filled their thoughts, and they drew to it like gravity. The Coven sisters skipped between Ley Lines, ricocheting from time to place until they found themselves swirling in the whirlpool accretion of a brilliant celestine goddess. Their queen.\n\nNot far beyond it, Austyn again saw the noise.\n\nShe kept her eye upon it while each of her sisters reached out, until the image of Mara Sov manifested and her words found footing in understanding. They focused their will upon her words, and before them, a pale screen of fog and glass gave way into a distant Ley Line beyond Sol.\n\n\"You have done well, my Techeuns,\" said Mara, stepping from the nothing and into their presence. She placed her hand on the Wayfinder's Compass. \"Take me home.\"\n\nThe Coven turned their minds back to the Dreaming City, to safety, to Petra. But as they began their return journey through the Ascendant Plane and across the Ley Lines, they felt the presence of another watching. At the edges of the accretion, a din of distorted noise pursued them.\n\nMara glowered at Austyn before turning and raising her palms. With a single word, the Ley Line shattered behind them, sending a lance of energy through the heart of the noise as they sped away toward the Dreaming City. \"I will not suffer a bloodied mongrel at my heels,\" whispered Mara. \"Keep your focus. She will be back.\"\n\nAustyn could feel the noise encircling them again, as it had done to her that night in her bed. It would suffocate them in this dream.\n\nEach time the Coven shifted Ley Lines, so too did the noise. She knew they could not escape it, and through her, so did her sisters. It descended upon them, and as it grew closer, the noise manifested into whispers. Austyn's mind could think of nothing but one name: Xivu Arath.\n\nShe could see the Dreaming City, but the image wasn't clear. The sharpness of the connection was darkening. Her sisters felt her worry. They did not have the strength to escape. Their minds aligned on an action. Austyn grabbed the compass and placed it in Mara Sov's hands. \"We will ensure your arrival.\"\n\nEach sister shifted her thoughts from the Dreaming City to her own corner of the Ascendant Plane, and with a burst of will, they scattered themselves across the Ley Lines. The noise halted momentarily and split in every direction to follow them.\n\nQueen Mara Sov crashed to her feet as she connected with the floor of the Blind Well.\n\n\"My queen!\" Petra looked to the quickly sealing rift from which she fell. \"Where are the others?\"","icon":null}},"430504837":{"hash":430504837,"index":1845,"redacted":false,"name":null,"iconImagePath":null,"colorImagePath":null,"displayProperties":{"name":"Pathfinder's Helm","description":"NEW COVEN - I\n\nPetra stood at the bordering cliff's edge of the Divalian Mists, wrapped in a concealing vapor. Beside her, Illyn, Techeun Coven Mother. A deluge of water spewed from deep within the stone below; gentle tremors rippled through their bodies without notice. The pure sky above them tore like well-worn fabric as fronds of malignant Taken growth crept into the Dreaming City.\n\n\"They will be upon us soon. It was not enough to simply halt Oryx's  advance,\" Petra said.\n\nShe had spent months of conversation building the kindling to an idea in Illyn's thoughts prior to the Battle of Saturn: a new Coven, a new class of sister recruits. Now, with the queen's flagship in ruins and the Coven missing several of its most skilled Techeuns, there was no longer the luxury of refusal.\n\n\"I can't hold the Reef with Corsairs alone. I can't search for the queen with looking glasses and a depleted armada. We need more Techeuns, Illyn. You know I'm right.\"\n\nIllyn shook her head. \"We are not weapons for the Queen's Wrath to command…\"\n\nThe Coven's reluctance to forge the next link in the chain of their lineage was a strong one. Since the formation of Eleusinia and the exploitation of Riven, the Elder Techeuns had grown protective of their arts. Techniques and texts were kept close. Despite all that, Petra knew Illyn had always been listening to her words. She too had dreamt of the Harbinger's failure. Of Oryx Taking her sisters.\n\n\"…We will snap shut the Ley Lines and seal the city,\" Illyn concluded.\n\n\"No!\" Petra retorted. \"The queen is lost and might still return.\" She turned to the Coven Mother. \"Of your seven, how many are still alive?\"\n\nPetra felt a mournful flame stoking beneath Illyn's visor. \"Precisely,\" Illyn said. \"We haven't the strength.\"\n\n\"Then heed my requests.\" Petra waved away the mist between them. \"Train more sisters.\"\n\nIllyn finally broke her gaze with the sky and scowled at Petra. \"We haven't the time. Training spans decades.\"\n\n\"Make. It. Work,\" Petra demanded before taking a breath and continuing. \"Illyn, I will do whatever you need. Please, can we work through this together?\"\n\nIllyn's head sunk. She leaned over the cliffside—over the stream of plummeting mist—and watched the flow of water drop into endlessness. \"Send me your candidates. I hope they are stronger than you were.\"","icon":null}},"493679463":{"hash":493679463,"index":1876,"redacted":false,"name":null,"iconImagePath":null,"colorImagePath":null,"displayProperties":{"name":"Eternal Recurrence","description":"Petra Venj found Jolyon on the range, as she'd expected. A lone figure, lying face down on the ridgeline, sighting a barely visible target on the far side of the ravine. \n\n\"You never really needed a spotter, did you?\" \n\n\"No,\" Jolyon replied, squinting up at her, \"but I always liked the company.\" He offered her a rangefinder. \"Care to join me?\" \n\nPetra settled down beside him, and sighted the next target. \n\nJolyon pressed his eye to The Supremacy's massive scope. \"I heard he's back,\" he said. \n\n\"Then you heard wrong.\" Petra squinted through the rangefinder. \"You know how it is with Guardians. He goes by 'Crow' now.\" \n\nJolyon snorted. \"Ironic. Only Uldren could make immortality a demotion.\" \n\n\"Wind is 16 kph from your nine, 4,700 meters out,\" Petra replied. \"Send it.\" \n\nJolyon let out a long, slow exhale. Then: a deafening BOOM as The Supremacy kicked. Petra didn't bother to check the target. \n\n\"He took a lot of abuse after he rezzed,\" she said, breaking the silence before it could fully settle. \"And never knew why. Gave him a bit of… humility. If you can believe it.\" \n\nJolyon lifted his head, shifting his focus from the scope to Petra's inscrutable expression. He raised an eyebrow. \"I'd like to see that for myself.\" \n\n\"I know.\" Petra pressed her lips together in sympathy. \"That's why I'm here. Mara thinks it's best if we limit his contact with others.\" \n\n\"Keeping him in her pocket, huh? Uldren might have changed, but it sounds like Queen Mara is the same as ever.\" \n\nPetra's tone hardened. \"Be that as it may, you've got your orders. Stay away.\" \n\n\"It's fine,\" Jolyon said with a smile. It did not reach his eyes. \"I've gotten used to Uldren being dead. Probably best he stays that way.\"","icon":null}},"579937656":{"hash":579937656,"index":34,"redacted":true,"name":null,"iconImagePath":null,"colorImagePath":null,"displayProperties":{"name":"Classified","description":"Keep it secret.

She had dreamt with Petra and harvested secrets from her, with the Queen's Wrath being none the wiser. Austyn knew they were meant to save Queen Mara Sov. They were meant to find her and restore the throne. She had been searching the Ley Lines for a path to the queen each night after her training.\n\nHer Coven sisters lay sleeping all around her body, but her mind flew through countless panes of prismatic glass. As they shattered, she flittered from one plane to the next, catching momentary glimpses of incommunicable wonder.\n\nIn the distant cosmos far ahead, Austyn saw a darkened haze of indecipherable noise. Somewhere nestled in the Ley Lines, this shadowed spot was growing. Austyn knew Mara Sov was distant. She knew the queen had obscured herself from her enemies.

Tonight, she would reach back.\n\nAustyn focused her will on a path to the distant noise and, as she did so, it was. The way was open, but still so far.

Weeks of intelligence and a handful of dead spies have brought her to a single point in space. This moment of opportunity.\n\nA massive, reinforced viewport extends from beneath her feet to the ceiling of the bridge. Through it, dead-still azure banners obscure the distant Awoken Reef. From Caiatl's perspective, it appears as a slurry of glitz and dust to be swept away at her command—an idea her advisors spoke of all too frequently. Their soft conflict with one city had left some eager for a decisive victory in another. It was a distraction.\n\nIn the space between Caiatl and the Reef, just beyond the unmoving banners, malachite-licked wisps of intent tear open the space between her and the shimmering dust. Long black spindles of Hive workmanship pierce the rift first, preceding a massive Tomb Carrier twice the size of her flagship.\n\nCaiatl addresses her bridge officers. \"Wait until they're through and cannot flee.\"\n\nHer destroyers take up flanking positions opposite of her own as Caiatl orders her flagship to maneuver above the massive Tomb Carrier.\n\nWhen the rift shuts, the order comes over Cabal comms: \"Strike.\"\n\nThe six destroyers spring their diversionary attack. Caiatl feels the pressure waves from their silent cannons wash over her as their shells detonate. Tomb Carrier and Cabal warcraft exchange a harrowing gauntlet of ordnance. The diversion is working.\n\n\"Point us straight at their midsection. Launch ballista crews,\" Caiatl barks. \"Inform me when they've taken the bridge.\"\n\nEmerald flare wells deep in the Tomb Carrier's main gun like a brewing cauldron lined with obsidian teeth. The barrel: a massive column of vertebrae from some leviathan creature, ignites with ten thousand Hive runes. The Tomb Carrier belches streams of malefic flame that effortlessly obliterates two spearheading Cabal destroyers. Caiatl steps forward in horror as their hulls erupt in a series of soulfire explosions.\n\n\"Don't let that gun fire again! Protect our destroyers!\" She pivots to her navigation office. \"Bring the ship to minimum jump speed. Full power to the mains!\"\n\nCaiatl thrusts a finger at the Tomb Carrier. \"Engage the Aries ram and prepare for impact!\"\n\nThe flagship hurtles toward the Tomb Carrier, unleashing a full salvo of cannons and warheads to soften the Carrier's carapace.\n\nCaiatl turns to a bridge crew Legionary as the Tomb Carrier rapidly expands in the viewport behind her. \"Fetch my shield.\"\n\n***\n\nOn the other side of the Reef, Queen Mara Sov watches through a Dreaming City aperture as the battle unfolds on her borders. The inscrutable expression on her face twists with each distant explosion. Petra wishes the small tensing motions would give some indication of what her queen is thinking. Instead, she sees only the cold stare of one predator assessing the size and strength of another.\n\nPetra looks to the knife Mara is idly toying with and notices a detail she hadn't before: a pair of kestrels etched into the blade, wings intertwined, linework so fine that she has to squint to recognize their silhouettes.\n\nPetra frowns. \"My queen?\" she asks, but Mara does not shift her attention from the battle.\n\n\"Caiatl's war games will keep Xivu Arath occupied while we focus on recovering our lost Techeuns,\" Mara says. She uses the point of the knife to trace the longest line along her palm. \"Neither will be able to launch a full-scale attack on the Dreaming City while the other is at her throat.\"\n\n\"Savathûn first?\" ventures Petra.\n\nMara's stoic façade cracks. She looks down at the blade, at the twin kestrels, and sees something in her own reflection that unsettles her.\n\n\"Savathûn first,\" she agrees, sheathing the weapon so she doesn't have to think about it.","icon":"/common/destiny2_content/icons/cfe3b2aee141b86b8bf2f6dce30dd0ea.png"}},"2957532337":{"hash":2957532337,"index":1840,"redacted":false,"name":null,"iconImagePath":null,"colorImagePath":null,"displayProperties":{"name":"Pathfinder's Helmet","description":"NEW COVEN - I\n\nPetra stood at the bordering cliff's edge of the Divalian Mists, wrapped in a concealing vapor.

The pure sky above them tore like well-worn fabric as fronds of malignant Taken growth crept into the Dreaming City.\n\n\"They will be upon us soon. It was not enough to simply halt Oryx's  advance,\" Petra said.\n\nShe had spent months of conversation building the kindling to an idea in Illyn's thoughts prior to the Battle of Saturn: a new Coven, a new class of sister recruits. Now, with the queen's flagship in ruins and the Coven missing several of its most skilled Techeuns, there was no longer the luxury of refusal.\n\n\"I can't hold the Reef with Corsairs alone. I can't search for the queen with looking glasses and a depleted armada. We need more Techeuns, Illyn.

Since the formation of Eleusinia and the exploitation of Riven, the Elder Techeuns had grown protective of their arts. Techniques and texts were kept close.

Of Oryx Taking her sisters.\n\n\"…We will snap shut the Ley Lines and seal the city,\" Illyn concluded.\n\n\"No!\" Petra  retorted. \"The queen is lost and might still return.\" She turned to the Coven Mother. \"Of your seven, how many are still alive?\"\n\nPetra felt a mournful flame stoking beneath Illyn's visor. \"Precisely,\" Illyn said. \"We haven't the strength.\"\n\n\"Then heed my requests.\" Petra waved away the mist between them. \"Train more sisters.\"\n\nIllyn finally broke her gaze with the sky and scowled at Petra. \"We haven't the time. Training spans decades.\"\n\n\"Make. It. Work,\" Petra demanded before taking a breath and continuing. \"Illyn, I will do whatever you need. Please, can we work through this together?\"\n\nIllyn's head sunk.

Beside her, Illyn, Techeun Coven Mother. A deluge of water spewed from deep within the stone below; gentle tremors rippled through their bodies without notice. The pure sky above them tore like well-worn fabric as fronds of malignant Taken growth crept into the Dreaming City.\n\n\"They will be upon us soon. It was not enough to simply halt Oryx's advance,\" Petra said.\n\nShe had spent months of conversation building the kindling to an idea in Illyn's thoughts prior to the Battle of Saturn: a new Coven, a new class of sister recruits. Now, with the queen's flagship in ruins and the Coven missing several of its most skilled Techeuns, there was no longer the luxury of refusal.\n\n\"I can't hold the Reef with Corsairs alone. I can't search for the queen with looking glasses and a depleted armada. We need more Techeuns, Illyn. You know I'm right.\"\n\nIllyn shook her head. \"We are not weapons for the Queen's Wrath to command…\"\n\nThe Coven's reluctance to forge the next link in the chain of their lineage was a strong one. Since the formation of Eleusinia and the exploitation of Riven, the Elder Techeuns had grown protective of their arts. Techniques and texts were kept close. Despite all that, Petra knew Illyn had always been listening to her words. She too had dreamt of the Harbinger's failure. Of Oryx Taking her sisters.\n\n\"…We will snap shut the Ley Lines and seal the city,\" Illyn concluded.\n\n\"No!\" Petra retorted. \"The queen is lost and might still return.\" She turned to the Coven Mother. \"Of your seven, how many are still alive?\"\n\nPetra felt a mournful flame stoking beneath Illyn's visor. \"Precisely,\" Illyn said. \"We haven't the strength.\"\n\n\"Then heed my requests.\" Petra waved away the mist between them. \"Train more sisters.\"\n\nIllyn finally broke her gaze with the sky and scowled at Petra. \"We haven't the time. Training spans decades.\"\n\n\"Make. It. Work,\" Petra demanded before taking a breath and continuing. \"Illyn, I will do whatever you need. Please, can we work through this together?\"\n\nIllyn's head sunk.

They say they can refocus Light \"through the prism of their will.\"\n\nWhile we at the Cryptarchy have nothing but respect for Eliksni culture, we wished to explore the truth behind these claims.\n\nAfter studying one of the few Splicer Gauntlets that fit non-Eliksni hands (graciously created by Mithrax, Kell of the House of Light, for select residents of the Last City), we have determined that the wrist-mounted Gauntlet is little more than a converter that can be used to focus trace amounts of residual Light already present in the environment.\n\nA trained Splicer can use their Gauntlet to interface with any latent data networks in the vicinity. This allows the bearer to access technological mundanities as well as deeper, infinitely more protected networks, including the Vex domain itself.\n\nOnce connected, access to these networks is severely limited for the Eliksni Sacred Splicers, though Guardians, due to their unique relationship with the Light, are able to manifest corporeally within the network for short periods of time. They can then alter the data found therein with focused percussive energy—including gunfire—in a baffling scientific process the Cryptarchy does not yet fully understand.\n\nThe Gauntlet seems capable of powering itself by transmuting unbound energy into Ether. Traditionally, Sacred Splicers would undertake great journeys to charge their Gauntlets with naturally occurring residual energy, but Guardians can use their martial prowess to convert their foes into bountiful energy sources.\n\nIn closing, the Sacred Splicers merely exploit a tool that induces Light to resonate at frequencies approaching that of the Vex Nexus, enabling them to access to certain low-security Vex systems. The Eliksni falsely believe that a deep spiritual connection allows them to bend the Light to their every whim, but this can be ea5ily dismissed as myth—the regre7able bypr0duc7 of ov3r@c71v3|| |  |    |        |\n\nIt is disappointing to hear such condescending generalizations from a species who so recently found themselves in the graces of the Great Machine.
