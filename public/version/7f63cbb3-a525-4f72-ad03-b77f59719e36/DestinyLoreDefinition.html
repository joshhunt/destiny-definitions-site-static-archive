This high up, the wind pulls at her cape, beckoning her farther along. \n\nThe streets below throng with celebrants. The Awoken among them—Earthborn, Reefborn, Lightbearers—all gleam twilight in Mara's mind. \n\nThe celebrations tonight are for the City; Mara has no wish to make herself a place in them. Instead, she walks alone and thinks to her first Night of Ascents. \n\nIt had trickled upwards to Mara from her people; a folk holiday that eventually turned into an institution. It took decades to settle into its current form: a journey through the dark on the anniversary of the Awoken exodus from the Distributary. \n\nOn that first night, Sjur had blown in like a breeze, banging the door open, equipped as always with sturdy boots and her longbow, ready to bully her queen outdoors. She had led Mara by the hand, laughing, and laughing Mara had let her. \n\nAs they walked, Sjur's were the strides of a tall woman used to outdoor work. Mara had the pace of a leader who primarily focused on cognitive action. The difference often slipped Sjur's mind. \n\n\"Slow down,\" Mara had said, as they neared the gates of the Watchtower. \n\n\"I could carry you.\" \n\n\"Don't,\" Mara retorted—too hastily, not stern enough to put off a woman like Sjur Eido. \n\nMara hurried through the gate before she could be picked up, Sjur lunging after her shouting, \"But my queen, my heart's calling is to serve you!\" \n\nThe night continued on as they walked the asteroids side by side through space's endless night, reliving memories of that first journey to the Reef: escaping the missiles that followed them through the wormhole. The giddy adrenaline and cool calculation needed to make it to their new home.  \n\nDespite the cold of the thin air, Sjur radiated warmth—enormous, laughing, alive. It was Sjur's hand on hers that Mara remembered most in later years. One moment tugging Mara towards a climb; the next, supporting Mara through a gully like the most courtly of knights. \n\nFor many years, it was Sjur at her side during the Night of Ascents. Other years Uldren, eager to show Mara some new vista, some ancient treasures along the way. Twice Riven, inspecting their masterwork together on long walks through the Dreaming City. \n\nIn the Reef and the Dreaming City, Mara's people celebrate together. Remember their history. Enact it, making it new, returning it to life. \n\nNow, she watches over the Awoken below, celebrating another holiday in a City with traditions of its own. \n\nAnd Mara walks alone, between the City and the dark outside.","icon":null}},"386385208":{"hash":386385208,"index":2588,"redacted":false,"name":null,"iconImagePath":null,"colorImagePath":null,"displayProperties":{"name":"Wyrmguard Greaves","description":"[Report by VanNet encrypted router.] \n\n[E-Morn//Link: NM-O01] \n\n[Msg-Archive//00192410] \n\nE-Morn: Your findings are consistent with mine.

This wish is granted through invocation of something known as the \"Anthem Anatheme,\" which appears to be a manner of subjecting reality to one's will, similar to a Lightbearer's ability to affect paracausality. However, little is known about how this process unfolds in practice. \n\nHenceforth, the \"wisher\" enters a binding contract with the Ahamkara, though many Ahamkara will purposefully manipulate or misinterpret the parameters of this contract to draw greater nourishment from it, often causing calamity to the wisher. \n\nLightbearers are expected to refrain from expressing wants or desires in the presence of an Ahamkara. \n\nVERIFIED: \n\n-Ahamkara bones somehow retain intelligence, sentience, and a manner of speech yet to be defined, post-mortem. It is surmised that an Ahamkara's corporeal body is not its true form, but a representation. \n-Ahamkara feed by granting wishes. These beings possess an innate ability to alter reality and consume the quantum chaos that results from such an act. This is theorized to allow them to \"transcend reality\". \n-Above information regarding altering reality supported by data confirming species-wide capability to shift form into a wide variety of living and inanimate structures.  \n-Wishes, while seemingly less potent and more difficult to initiate, are still able to be granted from Ahamkara bones. \n-Ahamkara are not solitary creatures. Many adults patrol vast distances across Sol alone, but their territories overlap, and disputes are rare. While Ahamkara do not typically hunt in packs, there have been sightings of hunting pairs. In fact, they do not appear to prey on each other at all.

For me, Stasis is intimately tied to perception. And to time. \n\nCZ: Time? \n\nEB: Yes. Stasis has the power to slow molecular activity. A process that we normally associate with gravity. Relativity, and all that. \n\nCZ: You're talking about time dilation.  \n\nEB: Exactly. We think of time as… steady. But that's only because we experience it from a fixed perspective. When I \"freeze\" something with Stasis, I'm changing its timeframe relative to myself and the world around me. \n\nCZ: Stasis relies in part on one's perception of reality. Is that why Osiris always emphasizes self-control in using the Darkness? \n\nEB: That's his way of framing things. He views Stasis as exerting authority over oneself and others. \n\nCZ: And you don't? \n\nEB: In my view, the goal of Stasis is not to control the object, or even my own mind. It's to change my perspective. To see the object moving at the speed of my thoughts, not the speed of matter. \n\nCZ: And just… seeing it differently is enough? \n\nEB: Is that so hard to imagine? It's very similar to how you use Void Light—manipulating spacetime and gravitational fields. In fact, I would argue that Void has more in common with Stasis than it does with Solar or Arc. Perhaps they're reverse sides of the same coin. \n\nCZ: And using Stasis doesn't… worry you? Even after everything you've seen? \n\nEB: It did. For a long time, I feared that using Stasis would corrupt me, as I'd seen others corrupted. But after what seemed like a thousand years trapped in that interminable loop, it gradually dawned on me: the fear was the corruption. As long as fear gripped me, Light or Darkness made no matter. Once I accepted that, the Darkness ceased to be frightening. It was another matter of perspective. \n\nCZ: Hmm. Thank you, Elsie. You've given me a lot to think about. For some reason, your explanation makes me more… comfortable… with the idea. \n\nEB: Any time, Commander. It's all a matter of perspective. \n\nTRANSCRIPTION ENDS","icon":null}},"2648530288":{"hash":2648530288,"index":2568,"redacted":true,"name":null,"iconImagePath":null,"colorImagePath":null,"displayProperties":{"name":"Classified","description":"Keep it secret.

So, who gets it?\" \n\nNivviks steps forward, swapping to Human speech. \"Mithrax ordered it destroyed or given to Dreaming City.

For the greater portion of those years, Sjur considered them friends. They dined delicately on her desire for news of worlds beyond the Reef, spinning truth and lies with the cackling enthusiasm of dedicated storytellers. \n\nBut now the Hunt had been called, and there was only one path into the future. \n\nSjur stood waiting at the center of the chamber, her fingers loose around the grip of her bow, her head bowed. \n\nAt last, the Ahamkara landed heavily to either side of her, scenting the air.  \n\n\"Are you unhappy?\" Huginn asked, surprised. \n\n\"What story was there that never ended?\" Muninn said. \n\n\"And can you not tell it again once it is over?\" said Huginn.  \n\n\"We will be as true and solid as bone, forever.\" Muninn yawned wide, his curling tusks scraping against one another.  \n\n\"Rhetoric,\" Sjur muttered. \n\nShe would miss them, all the same. Their shining inquisitiveness, their impossible wisdom. The fleeting grace of weapons purposefully sheathed.  \n\nAll of it lost in one dismal moment of surrender. Unless— \n\nHuginn tilted his head. Muninn parted his jaws to brandish a fanged smile.  \n\nSjur straightened to her full height. At her hip was the fractal knife she had been gifted from the Queen's own armory.

Several other named pouches dangle from her belt. \n\n \"Safe bet…\" Amrita chuckles, voice trailing in soft, tense coughs, and unsteady breathing. \n\n\"Stop trying to get up.\" Petra whisks the contents of the pouch with the applicator, stirring an aroma of mint, aloe, and musk into the air.
