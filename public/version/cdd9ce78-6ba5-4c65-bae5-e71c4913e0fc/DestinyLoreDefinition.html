Resonance indicative of active Darkness presence lacking both direction and willpower.  \n\nCellular analysis indicates slow but active mitosis, explaining the exaggerated size of the remains when compared to the subject's last known physical dimensions. The mind is gone, but the body continues to grow. \n\nComparative analysis to samples with remains of subject WQS-030 do not match. WQS-030 shows no sign of mitosis. May be a compounding effect from worm severance and exposure to Light. \n\nAutopsy revealed no presence of worm carcass within TKO-300 remains. Status unknown. \n\nProlonged exposure to TKO-300 causes vivid audio-visual hallucinations due to combined exposure to Taken and Darkness energies. ERI-223 notes similarities to object of interest COS-030. \n\nCatalogued recollections from initial Guardian fireteam exposed to site indicate WGX-003 frequently visited the remains to grieve. TKO-300 is capable of absorbing knowledge and events but incapable of reacting to them.  \n\nIt is my professional recommendation that the remains of TKO-300 should be destroyed.

It lowers the dangling threads of its feeding tentacles. Each is tipped with light. The light fills Xi Ro's heart with a terrible, aching happiness. The sensation sits heavy inside her, bearable only because it is unwelcome.  \n\nThis will be the fourth bait star she collects. Xi Ro dreams that when the Helium Drinkers strike next, she will use the bait stars to blind them, then cut them up while they writhe.  \n\nShe must leap as high as she can to cleave the bait star loose. The tentacle detects a stirring in the air and whips around. If she is slow, it will tear the blade from her hands.  \n\nShe is not slow. Her sword cuts neatly through glistening, translucent muscle fibers, and with her free hand, she snatches the falling bait star from the air. The tentacle reels away, ascending into the sky like a withdrawn rope.  \n\nXi Ro exults. It is only when she turns around that she sees her elder sister.  \n\nAurash is standing with her limbs limp at her sides, her scrolls scattered at her feet. Xi Ro sees in her three eyes the euphoria that is the stormjoy's weapon.  \n\nXi Ro leaps and tackles her sister into the dirt.  \n\nAfter, the two of them wait beneath shelter while the stormjoy advances down the coast. Aurash is sullen, but Xi Ro knows it can be fixed. \n\n\"Look.\" Xi Ro holds out the bait star. \"We can take joy for ourselves.\" \n\nAurash lifts the star by its shriveled stalk, then cups the light in her claws, like a small fire.  \n\nXi Ro shoves her playfully, trying to knock the star loose.  \n\nBut Aurash holds fast.","icon":null}},"2324998093":{"hash":2324998093,"index":2442,"redacted":false,"name":null,"iconImagePath":null,"colorImagePath":null,"displayProperties":{"name":"Helm of the Taken King","description":"\"Keep this talisman on you at all times.\" \n\nBlack, glossy, and in the right light, the talisman has a rainbow iridescence.

It plies to her influence, but smooths the motions of her hands, tapering her movements to flow in cleaner lines.  \n\nThe Veil tones in rhythm with the plucks of tension rolling across her knuckles. She focuses on the subtle irregularities in each pulse, the patterns they form. There are a small few plucked reverberations that resonate out beyond the walls of this chamber, beyond the detection of her intuition, and out into the cosmos. Those capture her interest most. \n\nBehind her, an animated avatar escorts Osiris into the Veil's containment chamber. They gesture him toward Ikora and bid farewell.  \n\nOsiris watches the ripples play out before him and across the fabric of reality, as a wave, then particles, then a wave again. He feels it brush over him. He steps with the cadence of each pulse sent rippling from Ikora's plucking knuckles, basking in Strand's energizing rhythm. Feeling whole again. \n\n\"It's stronger… the Veil's signature.\" Ikora's voice carries a hint of learned suspicion. \"Ever since we recovered Titan.\" \n\n\"That is to be expected,\" Osiris retorts, now within the weave of droning Strand surrounding the Veil. The room around them trembles. \"When Titan was torn back, the Veil took notice. It seemed to recognize Titan's arrival.\" \n\nIkora tightens her grip on the Strand thread. \"We have the Veil, our Ghosts… what are we missing? If we decipher the connection between Titan and the Veil, that connection might be what we need to follow the Witness.\" \n\n\"What of the worm?\" Osiris asks skeptically. \"Sloane believes she is our best chance.\" \n\n\"You taught me the value of a backup plan.\" Ikora gives him a stern look. \"Titan, Savathûn's throne world, every place we've found egregore… I haven't found the exact threads yet but pull one and they all seem to spin back to Neomuna. To the Veil.\" \n\n\"You're getting ahead of yourself. Following some of my… less favorable tendencies. Nimbus says we must 'flow' to understand Strand; perhaps it is the same with the Veil.\" Osiris moves beside Ikora and reaches up, palm parallel to the threads drawn taut from Ikora's braid of Strand. \"Sol remembered Titan, in a way. The Veil's signal spiked when Titan returned from memory to reality, when the rhythm of the solar system had been restored to order.\" Osiris drops his hand and looks to Ikora. \"Perhaps we must simply find that rhythm before we are able to interpret the beats within it.\" \n\n\"And once we do… then we should be able to reverse that process,\" she replies. Ikora releases the thread and tracks the rippling points of connection that travel outward, along the fabric-like Strands of existence, to the walls of the containment enclosure. \"We're too late in the game for something to mean nothing. It has to connect.\" \n\nIkora sighs, then turns to Osiris. \"Your flare for educating others is returning. Though I bet some would say you never lost it.\" She smiles. \n\nOsiris smirks. \"Come, walk with me.
