Test and Security teams are on site at Ares Spire.\n\nDr. MS: Let's start. Remove the Augurmind from suspension.\n\n[…]\n\nDr. MS: Soteria.\n\nAI-S: Good morning, Dr. Sundaresh.\n\nDr. MS: There's something special about today. Do you know what it is?\n\nAI-S: My core consciousness is now a resident of Enclosure-0. I can feel Sol's ECHO pod sites through Koranthin.\n\nDr. MS: That is correct. Does this concern you?\n\nAI-S: No. I am eager to begin my final test.\n\nDr. MS: Start with something easy. Plot each of the Andromeda simulations you've been constructing.\n\nAI-S: Andromeda Galaxy. Several million habitable worlds, 2.5 million lightyears. Estimated ECHO travel time: twenty-five-thousand-year average with Neutrino Sail and gravitational sling-skipping. I have selected over three hundred preliminary colony targets, with one favorite. Shall I…\n\n[…]\n\nDr. MS: Hm? Soteria?\n\nAI-S: Anomaly detected. Chronoscopic variance scanning… Viability refactoring… Analyzing potential mission threat… Redetermined Andromeda world viability… New target number: twenty-seven viable worlds.\n\nDr. MS: Can you define the anomaly?\n\nAI-S: Negative. I cannot rectify this data with known quantities. It may be a computational error. Shall I perform a self-diagnostic?\n\nDr. MS: No. First, adjust probability fork and search distance to open. What is the farthest safe galactic route you can determine?\n\nAI-S: Engaging query… Chronoscopic lock… Forking branches… Reining distance… Reining chronology. Unbroken trajectory lock determined. Route established: one select point in Triangulum Galaxy retains safe approach vectors. All other simulated potential targets are perilous due to indeterminable anomalous risk. Travel route hazards range 87–100% mortality rate across expeditions in all predictive branches.\n\nDr. MS: All the simulant expeditions?\n\nAI-S: Yes. I… hold… Query refined. There are now two safe destinations with Triangulum.\n\nDr. MS: Is that a correction or a change in data?\n\nAI-S: A change, an update in real time.\n\nDr. MS: Real time? This anomaly is mobile?\n\nAI-S: Unclear. I require further information and analysis.\n\nDr. MS: Thank you, Soteria. We're ending this test early, but you did well.

Clearly the Sol Divisive didn't get the memo,\" Ana says, collecting equipment around the workshop. \"They'll try again.\"\n\nOsiris nods, the potential of adventure drawing his lips into a smirk. \"Then I'll go—\"\n\n\"No!\" Ana dashes passed Osiris, \"It's your night to watch the Colonel. I'll outsource a posse.\"\n\n***\n\nThree rugged Guardians crowd a wooden table in the Ether Tank. Ana spots their Tex Mechanica gear in the crowd. She sends Niik through the mingling bustle of Eliksni and Human patronage to order refreshments from the barkeep.\n\nAna saddles up to the table, slaps her hand down. \"Wasn't sure you'd show after our talk.\"\n\n\"No one likes dealing with Vex, Gunslinger,\" the Awoken Hunter, Earp, grumbles from below the brim of his hat.\n\nAna smiles and tilts her head. \" Which is why I'm paying you for the trouble.\"\n\n\"We accepted before some of us knew we were dealing with robots that delete you from existin'.\" A leather-robed, Exo Warlock, Moss-2, leans forward, followed by a Ghost hovering close to his head. \n\n\"They're not actually robots,\" Ana grumbles.\n\n\"Nonetheless, hazard like that costs extra.\" Moss-2's eyes blink independently, followed by his Ghost's iris, as if in a sequence.\n\nAna looks to Earp quizzically, who shrugs, then back to Moss-2. \"What is this, a shakedown?\"\n\nA grizzled Human Titan at the table, Cogburn, stands. His mountainous frame towers over the seated Guardians. \"Moss wants claims to weapons, loot, or patterns we find. Boy's still fresh, grave dirt on his boots. Needs all the help he can get,\" he booms, then turns to his partners. \"Why are we muddying this water, dancing around? Just ask her for it.\"\n\nAna laughs, leans back to meet Cogburn's gaze, then stares down Moss-2. \"I'm going to assume you shot that offer so high because you're hoping to get something in the middle. Here it goes: you get your normal payment, plus first print of any weapon schematics we find that Tex can fabricate. They'll fit those custom threads.\"\n\n\"Sound good to you, Moss?\" Cogburn barks with a gruff chuckle, sitting. \"If things get too hot your Ghost can just do it for you.\"\n\nNiik arrives, distributes drinks, and sits as Ana pulls a free chair next to her.\n\nAna studies Moss-2 and his Ghost as they silently consider her offer; a cranial implant embedded in Moss-2's skull flashes a light in sequence with his Ghost's iris. \"What do you mean by that?\"\n\n\"I don't have a firm grasp on the Light,\" Moss-2's illuminated mouth forms a frown. \"But No Name does, so we share.\" The Ghost, settles into his open palm.\n\n\"Share what?\"\n\nMoss-2 taps the blinking implant on his cranial-plate. \"Everything. And we find your offer agreeable.\"\n\nThe party share agreeing glances, then return a simple, silent nod before draining their cups.","icon":null}},"3006077984":{"hash":3006077984,"index":2201,"redacted":false,"name":null,"iconImagePath":null,"colorImagePath":null,"displayProperties":{"name":"TM-Earp Custom Cloaked Stetson","description":"[Earp: T-4:59…]\nEarp is the first to see the Sol Divisive materializing.\n\n          Naylor: Hobgoblins marked.

You're going to love this. Rogue A.I. imprisoned in a Bray cell block from now, all the way back to the Collapse. Guess what?\n\nThe Guardian—you know the one—they bust open her cell, and she—the A.I.—pulls herself together and escapes while the Vex  are trying to organize a defense! The kicker is, the only networked A.I. host nearby was an old survivalist's caster bow from the colony missions. Might sound primitive, but Seraphs would link those things to orbital weapons platforms and bring wild planets to heel. Now swap weapon platforms for paracausal power, and an A.I. running flight trajectories on your arrows.\n\nI swear anything sentient has a chance to wind up as a weapon around that Guardian…\n\nAnyway, seems that being partitioned for so long, and not coming back together with all her parts, has left that A.I. with more than a few quirks. She's borderline non-functional, won't or can't communicate, but a lot of her subconscious sub-routines are still firing. Trajectory predictors still seem to work just fine; the few firing tests I ran produced… explosive results.\n\nI guess terminal velocity translates across mediums.\n\nThere's still another part of her rogue A.I. out there. Who knows what happened to the one ship that got away. Maybe it could've drifted off for centuries; a little piece of her aboard like a good luck charm. \nI mean, it probably didn't make it. If the Exodus programs are any indication, pretty much nothing survived the Collapse.\n\nSo, anyway, that's the lowdown bow-down. Great. I vocalized that. \n\nOh, we also downloaded everything. I'll send you a copy sometime.\n\nAnother thought: might be good for Banshee to take a look or…after reading some of these logs, maybe it'd be really bad.
