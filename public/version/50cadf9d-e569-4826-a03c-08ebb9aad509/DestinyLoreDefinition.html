Looking Back at the Great Disaster","description":"By Emmanuil Utkin, Staff Writer for the City Herald \n\nSeveral lifetimes have passed since the Vanguard suffered a blow from which many felt it might never recover. For the Lightless among us, the Great Disaster has become a fable: a story of monsters and tragic heroes encompassing the worst the universe can bring to bear.  \n\nFor many of the City's Guardians, however, the events of that time are not simply part of the historical record, but personal memory.  \n\n\"I'd never seen anything like it,\" Odon Kolos says. \"That army the Vanguard put together…\" \n\nEmboldened by initial victory against the Hive at the site of Burning Lake, the Vanguard and Consensus ordered a full-scale assault on the Moon. An army of Guardians thousands-strong marched against entrenched Hive forces—only to fall by the hundreds to a single Hive champion.  \n\nOdon was one of the lucky Guardians who managed to reach a transport before the Moon was abandoned in the retreat.  \n\n\"Turns out immortal doesn't mean invincible,\" Odon observes. \"Just means you stand a better chance of living with your mistakes.\"  \n\nThe Disaster spelled the beginning and the end for the Vanguard's military prospects. Any hope of formally organizing the City's Lightbearers dissipated. Contemporary records show that many felt the Guardian population soon became ungovernable—even disloyal—in the wake of the Vanguard's failure.  \n\nBut events in recent years suggest that Guardians do not require loyalty to a military command to compel them to place themselves in danger on behalf of the City. Whether driven by hope for humanity or a desire for wealth, Guardians have continued to face off against increasingly dire threats.  \n\n\"I used to run with Future War Cult,\" Odon tells me. \"I guess I started to think… maybe we win the little fights, but we're never going to do anything about the real enemies out there. That war will always be waiting.\"  \n\nHe laughs. \"And then someone comes along and kicks Crota's teeth in.\"","icon":"/common/destiny2_content/icons/bb1ae077d9bf1f783d80b035da8a087f.png"}},"1599691030":{"hash":1599691030,"index":2635,"redacted":false,"name":null,"iconImagePath":null,"colorImagePath":null,"displayProperties":{"name":"Grimoire: BRAVE Arsenal","description":"Lord Shaxx?

He invests great care in his designs. Still, sometimes a weapon has an unexpected kick. A side effect. He locks these away for special occasions. Other times, the Vanguard intervenes—you never know where you'll find the next Ghost-killer. \n\nBut outside the Crucible, the rules of engagement shift. There's no sense in leaving perfectly good armaments in storage. \n\nDon't worry, Namrask. I do not intend to abandon the Loom. I am merely… consulting. \n\nI am surprised Lord Shaxx let Drifter contribute. His aptitude is not in question, but I thought— \n\nWhat?

We're fighting for humanity,\" says Baishan, one of the Farm's technicians. Baishan is charged with maintaining the Farm's few precious remaining generators—and, more recently, its Ether processors. \"This is our world, and we're going to keep staking a claim.\"  \n\nNaomi, a pilot with Forces of the City, has been overseeing regular supply runs to the Farm in the wake of fierce bombardment by the Shadow Legion. She sees this as par for the course. \n\n\"Humans are good at adapting to just about anything,\" she observes.  \n\nFor many, the true revelations have come as a result of continued cooperation with new Eliksni neighbors.  \n\nLong-time Farm resident Carol notes, \"There's a lot about Fallen tech we couldn't have guessed at. With Skiris and Riksor helping out, we've cobbled together our own solar cell network. Our energy output is five times what it used to be.

Few of the people I interviewed seemed to have much interest in returning to the safety of the city walls.  \n\n\"The Witness tore down our cities, blighted our air and water, and sent raiders and monsters after us.

Therefore, Vanguard sources provided assistance contacting Neomuni citizens; we asked willing individuals to share their perspectives on the possibilities of a long-awaited reunion with Earth. \n\nDespite the dangers, many Neomuna denizens are optimistic about the curtain coming down some day in the future. A brief selection of their thoughts follows: \n\n\"I don't know how things would have shaken out if we'd stayed on Earth. Maybe we wouldn't have the CloudArk or nanotechnology.
