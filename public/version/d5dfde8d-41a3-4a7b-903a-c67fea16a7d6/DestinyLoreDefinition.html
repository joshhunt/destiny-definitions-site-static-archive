She dragged a hand through methane fluid to her faceplate, absentmindedly trying to rub the grogginess from her eyes.  \n\nMotion in the dark surrounding her kicked up clouds of fine grit.  \n\nHer headlights flared as her fingertips clinked against her helmet—a Thrall came screaming into the beam of light, bubbles spewing from its jaws. Sloane's eyes went wide before she reflexively flipped the Thrall over her shoulder and kicked its jaw through its skull. Her power suit spooled and pushed stimulants reactively. \n\nShe pivoted and caught the sword of a Knight mid-swing, snapping the weapon in two between the fingers of her gauntlet and driving a shard of broken blade into its chest. Another Thrall crossed her headlights just before a silver streak whistled through its throat. Sloane eyed a selection in her visor, which hi-lighted over thirty dead Hive, slowly deteriorating in boils of tiny, rumbling ignitions that sent nerve-spasms through their husks. Her visor cleared the readings and snapped onto a friendly.  \n\nSíocháin drifted forward, Hive viscera gently wafting into the sea from the slender razors protruding from her shell. \"You were out for days.\" \n\nSloane's face wrinkled in confusion. \"I remember the Pyramid wave. Falling… dreams. Are you okay?\" \n\n\"Hive found us, like you said,\" Síocháin said, retracting her blades. \n\nSloane grabbed the Ghost and hugged her to her power suit chassis for a moment. \"Little killer. Really gave 'em the business.\" \n\nSíocháin chirped. \"Pyramid wave swept over Titan, bounced around a bit and centralized where the Pyramid stopped. Gravity went crazy, then the ocean. I think we're a few miles from where we were when all this started.\" \n\n\"The Pyramid stopped? Then that's where we're headed… after we grab some gear,\" Sloane said. \n\nSíocháin dipped forward. \"One more thing. Something's out there circling us. Not Hive. Can't quite pin it down, but it's big.\" \n\n\"Yeah?\" Sloane said, thinking of what went through her mind before she lost consciousness. \"Then let's not waste any time getting out of here.\" \n\n*** \n\nSloane lifted herself from the ocean onto a half-submerged Arcology platform where she'd stowed a variety of rations and munitions since Titan's skies went dark. Her power suit clattered against the steel-mesh floor; she waited for the echoes to die down before taking a moment to exhale in silence. In that quiet moment, she made out a faint voice.  \n\nSíocháin rose into view. \"Do you hear that?\" \n\n\"Was about to ask you…\" Sloane said, standing. She snatched First In, Last Out from a stow locker, racked the foregrip, then followed the voice down a barnacle-crusted causeway to an old research lab with Síocháin in tow. \n\nFluid trickled down cracked walls surrounding rows of dead monitors. Glass reflected prismatic color from a gnarled tear in reality at the lab's center—as if it had been carved from another epoch and affixed to this one.  \n\nA Human that didn't seem to notice them paced within the tear—standing in a fully functioning mirage of the Arcology. Once he turned toward them, the tear spasmed and lurched forward and backward in time at erratic durations and speed. He was ripped both ways into non-existence as the tear flittered through events like a fourth-dimensional montage. \n\nThe tear held steady again, returning the man and his moment to existence. Síocháin took note of the badge on his coat that read \"Gideon Tepin—NPA—Senior Marine Biologist.\" \n\nTepin looked upset and turned away before speaking. \"She's afraid. That's why we're all having them. Something's wrong. She's showing us what's coming in plain view!\" The man angrily swiped his hand through the air in Sloane's direction. \"It's like she's screaming it into my head. I know I'm not the only one hearing it.\"  \n\n\"It chose us.\" He stepped forward and placed his hand on the border between then and now. \"I'm dreaming my own memories, but with little differences. Little omens. Black ships in the sky.\" \n\nSloane leaned forward, hand nearly pressed to that of the living memory playing out before her on the other side of the tear. \n\n\"She's trying to warn us. We should evacuate. We have to get her—\" \n\nThe tear lurched again, ripped away; lost to the rushing passage of time and blinked into non-existence. Gone. \n\nSloane dropped her hand. Jaw clenched. \"See if you can dig up any Arcology records on this.\" \n\n*** \n\n\"That marine biologist… Tepin… was he in some sort of captured time fluctuation? Is that… even possible?\" Sloane asked. \n\n\"I've never seen anything like it,\" Síocháin said. \"I'm not really sure.\" \n\nSíocháin skimmed archived reports. \"It's under 'TLev-01.' Looks like a psychic space whale some biologists were studying out in the ocean. They never got accurate measurements, but this estimate can't be correct. Over 150 meters? Report says it wasn't from here though, and refers to a lot of visions that personnel were having… which is… odd? Not a lot of alien species in Sol until after the Golden Age.\" \n\n\"I was having dreams while I was out, Síocháin. Of some other world, the Pyramid on Titan… the Tower. Like I remembered being there for each one.\" \n\n\"Well, I guess it could be an ancient space whale… or sometimes the Traveler gives people dreams. But are we going to ignore the obvious 'you were rendered unconscious by a Pyramid wave' explanation?\" \n\n\"No… but we've seen enough weird not to knock it,\" Sloane sighed.  \n\n\"Sure. I'll log that away,\" Síocháin said. \"You know… the readings coming from inside that field Tepin was in were consistent with atmospheric records on Titan during the Collapse.\" \n\n\"What does that mean?\" Sloane looked back to the spot of warped space-time. \"Was he… real?\" \n\n\"I don't know. I just know it wasn't a simulation.\"","icon":null}},"457617725":{"hash":457617725,"index":2451,"redacted":true,"name":null,"iconImagePath":null,"colorImagePath":null,"displayProperties":{"name":"Classified","description":"Keep it secret.

But as she walked outside to a flash, this time there was no thunder. \n\nIt had taken Sloane most of the morning after the Guardian had left to reach the surface. Waves were overtaking the rig platform, sloshing methane across the battle-marred power suit woven into Sloane's body. \n\n\"Hell…\" She straightened her spine within the suit and stared at the Pyramid through her HUD, watching it displace existence around it as it clawed a distorted path through the sky.   \n\nSíocháin zoomed toward her through a blur of flickering neon. \"Moving away from us.\" \n\n\"Shouldn't be moving at all.\" Sloane turned to her Ghost. \"Let's get that perimeter set. The Hive'll come again tonight.\" \n\nBefore she could move, the Pyramid began shedding Scales from its hull. They hovered for a moment over where they'd detached and peeled away, revealing opalescent flesh. \n\nSuddenly, the Pyramid emitted a wave that struck Titan, and a half-remembered tone resonated through Sloane's mind. With it, a lifetime: every experienced moment in a slurry of vivid flashes, condensed into simultaneous chaotic anarchy, grasping at grief, joy, anger, love. Seen from where she stood, past experiences gained new perspectives; memories best left dusted with rosy haze shrank under harsh light. Warmth, too fleeting, cold, still, ever frigid in its isolation…  \n\nAnd something else, sifting through it all, drawing it to order, as if rearranging fractured collagic panes into a new image.  \n\nShe struggled to breathe, and her suit flexed against the weight of her years, splayed out across time in violating fashion. Then just as suddenly, they were gone, faded into dreams.  \n\nThe sky turned black and orange like a fire-screen, and thunder resonated. \n\nSloane's body pitched forward over the platform, sinking through air, then sea. Heavy metal was swallowed whole; consciousness faded into the black. \n\nHer experience tumbled through sharded eras of reality like an astral projection, even as she felt her feet still firmly planted in the present. A cascade of timeless scenes whirled by, like panes of life captured in glass, in an indefinite stream of consciousness. Scenes of Titan, of a vibrant seascape installation. Too familiar not to be memories. \n\nNot hers, but no less real. \n\nTheir point of focus left Titan, dragged backwards across the lonely expanse of space to a world she'd never seen.  \n\nIts seas full of vivacious promise. Its moons conceal a Watcher in the sky. Its waves breed insidious appetite in the deep. \n\nThere is a temptation there she craves but does not understand. Unnatural and cursed. \n\nShe fell again, guided. Through a song, a memory, an image of a dream bent into perception like a focusing lens. Unreality coated in familiar skin. An attempt at understanding. \n\nThe Tower. Friends and comrades. Shine and grime, all. A heralded return. A shadow drawn overhead. A battle delayed, returning. \n\nThe Tower, a time yet lived. Black shadows that would fill an empty void in the sky, extending impaling blades down into the streets. Pinning life in paralytic mockeries of contentment. A display that strangles agency. \n\nA serpent winds a path beneath the shadow and offers to guide.  \n\nShe remembered this happening, and that it had not yet happened.","icon":null}},"540625098":{"hash":540625098,"index":2453,"redacted":true,"name":null,"iconImagePath":null,"colorImagePath":null,"displayProperties":{"name":"Classified","description":"Keep it secret.

He leans forward and places it on an intersection of lines seared into a thick leather mat. He taps the table beneath it. \"These stones are like legions raising your banner. Each one placed is a claim.\" \n\nHe leans back in his seat and gestures to her. \"Turn.\" \n\nCaiatl's eyes remain on the spot where Saladin placed his stone. She flicks an azure stone from her bowl onto the mat, then nudges the stone adjacent to Saladin's last placement. \n\n\"Aggressive. But the object isn't to kill. Establish borders. Hold territory.\" Saladin's words are measured as he places a counter-stone. \n\nCaiatl considers a flanking maneuver, then a defensive line, or— \n\n\"Speaking of… borders…\" Caiatl flanks. \"You place too many between yourself and your Legionaries.\" \n\nSaladin looks up, then back to the board. \n\nCaiatl continues. \"It is how Tarnth chooses to die. Rather than ossify into an immobile monument of bone, drawn on a cart that the young may hear their wisdom.\" \n\nSaladin shoots her a look, then connects a line of stones in defense. \"I'm not an executioner.\" \n\n\"You carry a large axe,\" she spars, placing another stone by his. \n\nHe groans and places a stone away from the clash. \n\n\"Tarnth respects your command, she bears your Iron Banner.\" Caiatl continues, \"Death by your hand would be an honor.\" \n\nSaladin sighs. \"That's not how I see it.\" \n\n\"Because it is not YOUR custom.

That's an order.\" \n\n\"But that's—I was saying that to you!\" The Ghost zipped forward. \"Hey! Don't walk away from me!\" \n\nSloane stopped. The heavy metal around her boots sank into the silty sea floor. \"I'm not—there's NOWHERE to walk away TO!

Waves were overtaking the rig platform, sloshing methane across the battle-marred power suit woven into Sloane's body. \n\n\"Hell…\" She straightened her spine within the suit and stared at the Pyramid through her HUD, watching it displace existence around it as it clawed a distorted path through the sky.   \n\nSíocháin zoomed toward her through a blur of flickering neon. \"Moving away from us.\" \n\n\"Shouldn't be moving at all.\" Sloane turned to her Ghost. \"Let's get that perimeter set.

They hovered for a moment over where they'd detached and peeled away, revealing opalescent flesh. \n\nSuddenly, the Pyramid emitted a wave that struck Titan, and a half-remembered tone resonated through Sloane's mind. With it, a lifetime: every experienced moment in a slurry of vivid flashes, condensed into simultaneous chaotic anarchy, grasping at grief, joy, anger, love. Seen from where she stood, past experiences gained new perspectives; memories best left dusted with rosy haze shrank under harsh light. Warmth, too fleeting, cold, still, ever frigid in its isolation…  \n\nAnd something else, sifting through it all, drawing it to order, as if rearranging fractured collagic panes into a new image.  \n\nShe struggled to breathe, and her suit flexed against the weight of her years, splayed out across time in violating fashion. Then just as suddenly, they were gone, faded into dreams.  \n\nThe sky turned black and orange like a fire-screen, and thunder resonated. \n\nSloane's body pitched forward over the platform, sinking through air, then sea. Heavy metal was swallowed whole; consciousness faded into the black. \n\nHer experience tumbled through sharded eras of reality like an astral projection, even as she felt her feet still firmly planted in the present. A cascade of timeless scenes whirled by, like panes of life captured in glass, in an indefinite stream of consciousness. Scenes of Titan, of a vibrant seascape installation. Too familiar not to be memories. \n\nNot hers, but no less real. \n\nTheir point of focus left Titan, dragged backwards across the lonely expanse of space to a world she'd never seen.  \n\nIts seas full of vivacious promise. Its moons conceal a Watcher in the sky. Its waves breed insidious appetite in the deep. \n\nThere is a temptation there she craves but does not understand. Unnatural and cursed. \n\nShe fell again, guided. Through a song, a memory, an image of a dream bent into perception like a focusing lens. Unreality coated in familiar skin. An attempt at understanding. \n\nThe Tower. Friends and comrades. Shine and grime, all. A heralded return. A shadow drawn overhead. A battle delayed, returning. \n\nThe Tower, a time yet lived.

Síocháin surveyed the mix of ancient rig foundations and natural stone. It seemed quiet enough, and Sloane needed rest. No Hive barnacles grew there. Ahsa had swam far from the largest concentrations of Hive and Taken and hid away in a cove tucked beneath Golden Age wreckage. \n\nAhsa filled the yawning space. She slipped through gaps and wrapped herself around plunging stalactites, her serpent-worm segmentations gripping the stone, her face half-submerged in slick methane liquid.  \n\nSíocháin floated down from Ahsa's back and turned to see Sloane slide and crumple to the cave floor as trails of steam seeped from the cracks in the ground beneath her. \n\nSloane closed her eyes. \"It's cold here, but the steam… it's warm,\" she said weakly. \n\nThe worm coiled a section of her body around Sloane, trapping in the heat around her.  \n\nSíocháin watched every exchange between the two and drifted out of Sloane's earshot to the worm's gargantuan face. Ahsa's attention snapped to the blades now protruding from the Ghost's shell.  \n\nThe Ghost got good and close. \"I don't know why you helped us. You seem nice. I hope you stay that way. If you're using her, if you turn coat…\" Síocháin sliced the air. \"I'll gut you.\"  \n\nAhsa's massive eye dialed in on Síocháin's iris. The two stared unblinkingly until the worm's eyelid gently closed. She emitted a tone of contrite harmonic equilibrium:   \n\n|I am not your enemy|  \n\nThe Ghost scanned the worm's face, and upon seeing its benign softness, retired to the coiled shelter Ahsa had woven them.  \n\nSloane sat in meditation within, radiating a sense of peace that Síocháin hadn't felt from her in months. The Ghost let herself pretend for a moment that even she felt almost safe.  \n\n*** \n\nIt was morning before Sloane woke. Ahsa met Sloane's eyes through her visor. The tilt of her enormous head signaled a sort of greeting or eagerness. Sloane removed her helmet. \"Need something?\" \n\n         |Aiat| \n\nAiat |Ahsa| Aiat \n\n         |Aiat| \n\nSloane stumbled backwards into the cavern wall.

It's… Ahsa.\" \n\n\"What's an Ahsa?\" Síocháin questioned. \n\n\"Some kind of… proto-worm?\" \n\n\"Like HIVE?!\" Síocháin deployed her blades. \n\n\"No… the Hive were something before they were Hive, right? The… worm gods were too.

We like big powerful allies… let's hear what they have to say.\" \n\nA joyful shiver trundled from Ahsa's head down through her coiled form, rippling the methane pooled around her, sending tremors through the stone, causing crumbled dust to rain from overhead.

But Ahsa maintained her gaze, and Sloane was swept back into the current. \n\n\"A blade… with ambition… I don't… I don't understand.\" \n\nFlashes of fratricidal frenzy ensue: a slither-mass carnage. Those once ever-bonded now drive fang and lash of tail; proclaim Deep magics once thought too cruel to utter. All in pursuit of a sacred, gifted logic.  \n\nVortexes that drink empty fathoms of encrimsoned Fundament sea churn above the fray. Ahsa cannot escape the writhe without unraveling from her captors with violence. She stains her fangs with the flesh of siblings turned rivals. \n\n\"Blood… betrays blood. To prove strength.

Cosmic language bathes her as she ventures—radio-songs and magnetic roars that bellow across space. She slips between worlds across great distances, breaches back into space to glide along the curvature of galaxies, chasing a distant point of Light. A solar opposite to that which Takes love. \n\nSloane gasped for air. \"She came here for a chance to live.\" \n\nAhsa crashes through Titan's thick skin and into its methane sea.

Since the Collapse, its Darkness has seeped into Luna, into all that surround it. Could one write a treatise on the subspecies of Hive, on the differences written in the various plates of chitin? Have the Hive been here long enough, overrunning our Luna, that a recognizable change in them has evolved?\n\n…I digress. There were times, deep in that dark pit, when I thought: Ah, Sai means to break left. And then she would, knives like lightning, as true as if she herself had told me she would. Or: Ah, there is Omar, beside me, and though he was not, his presence rang comforting in my ears like struck metal.\n\nSynergy, I thought. The closeness that combat creates. We were pinned together in the dark, and so we learned to read each other perfectly, for to do otherwise would have been to die.\n\nTo die sooner.\n\nAnecdata? Perhaps. Always the quiet voice that says to temper my expectations, that it is wishful thinking to imagine that they lie beside my heart, instead of Nightmares floating in my wake. But in all this time, all of this lingering, I am surer of what I felt then. Not only necessity; not only the edge of the blade.\n\nI know more of Darkness now. It is not violence. It is something more: something that hums and flows and resonates, knife or song by equal measure.\n\nI have not been able to bear the sound of silence since that time. Too long among the screaming Hive, I thought once.

Here is a shape—I see it as a sharpness, like a starless cutout against a distant galaxy, made clear in the negative space. The thoughts of the Hive, I might guess, but it is not quite the same. Purpose and sharpness are discrete from each other here.

Together with her Ghost, she'd chased the Pyramid's signals across Titan, but arrived too late at each coordinate site. They'd encountered nothing more than further wounds in the fabric of reality; slivered glimpses into moments held in Titan's memory. Occasionally, discarded Shrieker cores littered a site—evidence of a ritual gone cold, but not so cold that Síocháin couldn't detect figments of resonant residue that drove her scanners haywire. \n\nMore than once, Sloane had found a clutch of disoriented Fallen scattered around these wounds, some in a stupor, most driven violently mad. Síocháin said their brain patterns were fractured—synapses burnt into conflicting circuited loops—as if their collection of experiences had been dissected and left disparate and apart.  \n\nBut Sloane felt drawn, across the barren seafloor, to each new site shrouded in sunless shadow. Something cut through that Dark. Guided her. As if she drafted behind a rogue wave. \n\n\"We're almost to the next site,\" Síocháin said. \n\n\"Let's pick it up.\" The methane flowed over Sloane's armor in a slick, slipstream current that left a long tail of particulate floating in her wake, agitated by oxygen bubbles spurting from her mask. Síocháin followed close behind, sweeping the area with light beams that dissipated over vast, featureless depths. \n\n\"Resonant Pyramid energy, neutrino dispersals, and some kind of… quantum entangling? That's the best I can make of it,\" Síocháin said, razor blades deployed. \"The Pyramid's moving again.\"  \n\n*** \n\nThe site seemed quiet on the surface. Sloane glanced over a sea cliff and tapped Síocháin, who had been leering out at the expansive of dark ocean as if she was tracking something.  \n\n\"You ready?\"  \n\nThe Ghost turned to Sloane and hesitantly tilted her shell into a nod. \n\nThey killed their lights, allowing the bio-luminescent coral around them to illuminate the path down to a newly split-open gorge infested with Taken corruption. Sloane swapped her visor to a thermal targeting overlay and slipped over the edge of the chasm. Tendrils of Taken malignance flowed from the split ground beneath her, dancing in the methane like noxious filaments. The fissure looked large enough for her to finagle her suit through safely.  \n\nSloane glanced over her shoulder and held up a hand to Síocháin. \"Watch my back… from a distance.\" \n\n\"Uh, no. I can fight,\" she bit back defiantly. \"Fallen, Hive, and Taken are all over this sector.\" \n\n\"Lie low on this one. If something goes wrong, it can't go wrong with you. Get me?\" \n\nShe landed in a small cavern where a tangle of Taken threads writhed around a decrepit Hive sigil of resilient witchcraft. Whispers spewed from the sigil, wrapped around her mind, coaxed her forward. She reached a hand toward the sigil, and methane burst around her like depth charges as Taken blights manifested a small detachment of soldiers. \n\nSloane spun, her fists crackling with lightning—her fingers weaving her Arc Light safely through the methane around her. She charged the first of three blights, thruster-dodging incoming fire pinged by her HUD. She broke through the blight screen, planted her feet, and threw a lightning punch like a gauss cannon, atomizing the Taken and the blight itself. Her power suit carried her fulgurate fists from hostile to hostile in rising, truculent battle-fervor. \n\nWhen the cavern quieted, Sloane turned back to the sigil and called Síocháin down. \"I can… hear the Taken through this sigil… thing. It's like they're broadcasting out loud. Not in words but… their proximity, like sonar. Can you tap into it?\" \n\nSíocháin's concerned response was muffled by an intrusive thought echoing from somewhere far off, circling the sea around her and draining off into her mind. \n\n|Take| \n\n|Live| \n\nSloane thought of the ocean shelves crawling with the Pyramid's minions, their rituals and corruption sinking deeper into Titan's mantle by the day. Of the armies they threatened to summon, of what they searched for in the deep. \n\nShe thought of the Fallen who had no way to flee, shocked into madness by the reality-wounding waves that swept over Titan like a grey-matter line. A terminator of experience, via suspension within it. With this foreknowledge of her enemies' plans, maybe she could be a step ahead of dusk. \n\n|Take| \n\n |Live| \n\nSloane stepped forward, dazed—her mind drowning in the ocean's dangers—and gripped the sigil. The rippling Taken energy immediately backfired in a blinding burst of energy. \n\n\"No!\" Síocháin dove forward in horror as Taken tendrils twisted around Sloane's armor and dragged her to the ground.  \n\n\"SLOANE!\" \n\nAs tendrils buried themselves into her flesh, Sloane heard a new voice, clear as sirens in a storm. \n \nWARRIOR OF THE SKY.  \n\nYOU ARE KNOWN TO ME.  \n\nI ACCEPT YOUR CHALLENGE.","icon":null}},"1757202961":{"hash":1757202961,"index":2401,"redacted":true,"name":null,"iconImagePath":null,"colorImagePath":null,"displayProperties":{"name":"Classified","description":"Keep it secret.

He did not trust peace either.\" \n\nSkiris thinks about that House's great fleet, shattered by the Awoken Kell before it could ever threaten this world. \n\n\"This is different.\" They are not servants to the Awoken.

So is she, because Riksor's confidence helps quiet the insistent thought that disaster will come the instant Skiris stops worrying. \n\n\"Someday,\" Riksor says, \"this world will belong to all of us.\" \n\nShe looks at him sharply. \"The Eliksni?\" \n\nHe laughs. \"To Eliksni, too.\"","icon":null}},"2007908580":{"hash":2007908580,"index":2423,"redacted":false,"name":null,"iconImagePath":null,"colorImagePath":null,"displayProperties":{"name":"NPA \"Weir-Walker\" Grips","description":"REPULSION LATTICE INTEGRITY… NOMINAL \nOXYGEN SIEVE… NOMINAL \nDEPTH… 106m \n\nThe lettering on Sloane's HUD clarified into vision. She dragged a hand through methane fluid to her faceplate, absentmindedly trying to rub the grogginess from her eyes.  \n\nMotion in the dark surrounding her kicked up clouds of fine grit.  \n\nHer headlights flared as her fingertips clinked against her helmet—a Thrall came screaming into the beam of light, bubbles spewing from its jaws. Sloane's eyes went wide before she reflexively flipped the Thrall over her shoulder and kicked its jaw through its skull. Her power suit spooled and pushed stimulants reactively. \n\nShe pivoted and caught the sword of a Knight mid-swing, snapping the weapon in two between the fingers of her gauntlet and driving a shard of broken blade into its chest. Another Thrall crossed her headlights just before a silver streak whistled through its throat. Sloane eyed a selection in her visor, which hi-lighted over thirty dead Hive, slowly deteriorating in boils of tiny, rumbling ignitions that sent nerve-spasms through their husks. Her visor cleared the readings and snapped onto a friendly.  \n\nSíocháin drifted forward, Hive viscera gently wafting into the sea from the slender razors protruding from her shell. \"You were out for days.\" \n\nSloane's face wrinkled in confusion. \"I remember the Pyramid wave. Falling… dreams. Are you okay?\" \n\n\"Hive found us, like you said,\" Síocháin said, retracting her blades. \n\nSloane grabbed the Ghost and hugged her to her power suit chassis for a moment. \"Little killer. Really gave 'em the business.\" \n\nSíocháin chirped. \"Pyramid wave swept over Titan, bounced around a bit and centralized where the Pyramid stopped. Gravity went crazy, then the ocean. I think we're a few miles from where we were when all this started.\" \n\n\"The Pyramid stopped? Then that's where we're headed… after we grab some gear,\" Sloane said. \n\nSíocháin dipped forward. \"One more thing. Something's out there circling us. Not Hive. Can't quite pin it down, but it's big.\" \n\n\"Yeah?\" Sloane said, thinking of what went through her mind before she lost consciousness. \"Then let's not waste any time getting out of here.\" \n\n*** \n\nSloane lifted herself from the ocean onto a half-submerged Arcology platform where she'd stowed a variety of rations and munitions since Titan's skies went dark. Her power suit clattered against the steel-mesh floor; she waited for the echoes to die down before taking a moment to exhale in silence. In that quiet moment, she made out a faint voice.  \n\nSíocháin rose into view. \"Do you hear that?\" \n\n\"Was about to ask you…\" Sloane said, standing. She snatched First In, Last Out from a stow locker, racked the foregrip, then followed the voice down a barnacle-crusted causeway to an old research lab with Síocháin in tow. \n\nFluid trickled down cracked walls surrounding rows of dead monitors. Glass reflected prismatic color from a gnarled tear in reality at the lab's center—as if it had been carved from another epoch and affixed to this one.  \n\nA Human that didn't seem to notice them paced within the tear—standing in a fully functioning mirage of the Arcology. Once he turned toward them, the tear spasmed and lurched forward and backward in time at erratic durations and speed. He was ripped both ways into non-existence as the tear flittered through events like a fourth-dimensional montage. \n\nThe tear held steady again, returning the man and his moment to existence. Síocháin took note of the badge on his coat that read \"Gideon Tepin—NPA—Senior Marine Biologist.\" \n\nTepin looked upset and turned away before speaking. \"She's afraid. That's why we're all having them. Something's wrong. She's showing us what's coming in plain view!\" The man angrily swiped his hand through the air in Sloane's direction. \"It's like she's screaming it into my head. I know I'm not the only one hearing it.\"  \n\n\"It chose us.\" He stepped forward and placed his hand on the border between then and now. \"I'm dreaming my own memories, but with little differences. Little omens. Black ships in the sky.\" \n\nSloane leaned forward, hand nearly pressed to that of the living memory playing out before her on the other side of the tear. \n\n\"She's trying to warn us. We should evacuate. We have to get her—\" \n\nThe tear lurched again, ripped away; lost to the rushing passage of time and blinked into non-existence. Gone. \n\nSloane dropped her hand. Jaw clenched. \"See if you can dig up any Arcology records on this.\" \n\n*** \n\n\"That marine biologist… Tepin… was he in some sort of captured time fluctuation? Is that… even possible?\" Sloane asked. \n\n\"I've never seen anything like it,\" Síocháin said. \"I'm not really sure.\" \n\nSíocháin skimmed archived reports. \"It's under 'TLev-01.' Looks like a psychic space whale some biologists were studying out in the ocean. They never got accurate measurements, but this estimate can't be correct. Over 150 meters? Report says it wasn't from here though, and refers to a lot of visions that personnel were having… which is… odd? Not a lot of alien species in Sol until after the Golden Age.\" \n\n\"I was having dreams while I was out, Síocháin. Of some other world, the Pyramid on Titan… the Tower. Like I remembered being there for each one.\" \n\n\"Well, I guess it could be an ancient space whale… or sometimes the Traveler gives people dreams. But are we going to ignore the obvious 'you were rendered unconscious by a Pyramid wave' explanation?\" \n\n\"No… but we've seen enough weird not to knock it,\" Sloane sighed.  \n\n\"Sure. I'll log that away,\" Síocháin said. \"You know… the readings coming from inside that field Tepin was in were consistent with atmospheric records on Titan during the Collapse.\" \n\n\"What does that mean?\" Sloane looked back to the spot of warped space-time. \"Was he… real?\" \n\n\"I don't know. I just know it wasn't a simulation.\"","icon":null}},"2213223388":{"hash":2213223388,"index":2424,"redacted":false,"name":null,"iconImagePath":null,"colorImagePath":null,"displayProperties":{"name":"NPA \"Weir-Walker\" Jacket","description":"Sloane deftly maneuvered across the open ocean floor. Together with her Ghost, she'd chased the Pyramid's signals across Titan, but arrived too late at each coordinate site. They'd encountered nothing more than further wounds in the fabric of reality; slivered glimpses into moments held in Titan's memory. Occasionally, discarded Shrieker cores littered a site—evidence of a ritual gone cold, but not so cold that Síocháin couldn't detect figments of resonant residue that drove her scanners haywire. \n\nMore than once, Sloane had found a clutch of disoriented Fallen scattered around these wounds, some in a stupor, most driven violently mad. Síocháin said their brain patterns were fractured—synapses burnt into conflicting circuited loops—as if their collection of experiences had been dissected and left disparate and apart.  \n\nBut Sloane felt drawn, across the barren seafloor, to each new site shrouded in sunless shadow. Something cut through that Dark. Guided her. As if she drafted behind a rogue wave. \n\n\"We're almost to the next site,\" Síocháin said. \n\n\"Let's pick it up.\" The methane flowed over Sloane's armor in a slick, slipstream current that left a long tail of particulate floating in her wake, agitated by oxygen bubbles spurting from her mask. Síocháin followed close behind, sweeping the area with light beams that dissipated over vast, featureless depths. \n\n\"Resonant Pyramid energy, neutrino dispersals, and some kind of… quantum entangling? That's the best I can make of it,\" Síocháin said, razor blades deployed. \"The Pyramid's moving again.\"  \n\n*** \n\nThe site seemed quiet on the surface. Sloane glanced over a sea cliff and tapped Síocháin, who had been leering out at the expansive of dark ocean as if she was tracking something.  \n\n\"You ready?\"  \n\nThe Ghost turned to Sloane and hesitantly tilted her shell into a nod. \n\nThey killed their lights, allowing the bio-luminescent coral around them to illuminate the path down to a newly split-open gorge infested with Taken corruption. Sloane swapped her visor to a thermal targeting overlay and slipped over the edge of the chasm. Tendrils of Taken malignance flowed from the split ground beneath her, dancing in the methane like noxious filaments. The fissure looked large enough for her to finagle her suit through safely.  \n\nSloane glanced over her shoulder and held up a hand to Síocháin. \"Watch my back… from a distance.\" \n\n\"Uh, no. I can fight,\" she bit back defiantly. \"Fallen, Hive, and Taken are all over this sector.\" \n\n\"Lie low on this one. If something goes wrong, it can't go wrong with you. Get me?\" \n\nShe landed in a small cavern where a tangle of Taken threads writhed around a decrepit Hive sigil of resilient witchcraft. Whispers spewed from the sigil, wrapped around her mind, coaxed her forward. She reached a hand toward the sigil, and methane burst around her like depth charges as Taken blights manifested a small detachment of soldiers. \n\nSloane spun, her fists crackling with lightning—her fingers weaving her Arc Light safely through the methane around her. She charged the first of three blights, thruster-dodging incoming fire pinged by her HUD. She broke through the blight screen, planted her feet, and threw a lightning punch like a gauss cannon, atomizing the Taken and the blight itself. Her power suit carried her fulgurate fists from hostile to hostile in rising, truculent battle-fervor. \n\nWhen the cavern quieted, Sloane turned back to the sigil and called Síocháin down. \"I can… hear the Taken through this sigil… thing. It's like they're broadcasting out loud. Not in words but… their proximity, like sonar. Can you tap into it?\" \n\nSíocháin's concerned response was muffled by an intrusive thought echoing from somewhere far off, circling the sea around her and draining off into her mind. \n\n|Take| \n\n|Live| \n\nSloane thought of the ocean shelves crawling with the Pyramid's minions, their rituals and corruption sinking deeper into Titan's mantle by the day. Of the armies they threatened to summon, of what they searched for in the deep. \n\nShe thought of the Fallen who had no way to flee, shocked into madness by the reality-wounding waves that swept over Titan like a grey-matter line. A terminator of experience, via suspension within it. With this foreknowledge of her enemies' plans, maybe she could be a step ahead of dusk. \n\n|Take| \n\n |Live| \n\nSloane stepped forward, dazed—her mind drowning in the ocean's dangers—and gripped the sigil. The rippling Taken energy immediately backfired in a blinding burst of energy. \n\n\"No!\" Síocháin dove forward in horror as Taken tendrils twisted around Sloane's armor and dragged her to the ground.  \n\n\"SLOANE!\" \n\nAs tendrils buried themselves into her flesh, Sloane heard a new voice, clear as sirens in a storm. \n \nWARRIOR OF THE SKY.  \n\nYOU ARE KNOWN TO ME.  \n\nI ACCEPT YOUR CHALLENGE.","icon":null}},"2274944459":{"hash":2274944459,"index":2419,"redacted":true,"name":null,"iconImagePath":null,"colorImagePath":null,"displayProperties":{"name":"Classified","description":"Keep it secret.

Or… more like thinking at me.\" Silence hung over them for a moment before being swept away by the current. \n\n\"Oh… is it now? Care to share more about that?\" the Ghost asked with restrained frustration. \n\n\"Whatever's out there… I think it's guiding us. Or trying to see if it can trust us. If we're… compatible?\" \n\n\"Oh, that's good and vague,\" Síocháin hissed. \"You're sure that's what it wants? Because we have a HIVE GOD chasing us. We don't have the luxury of guessing wrong.\" \n\n\"It's just a feeling—not really my thing—but my gut tells me it's well-intentioned.

You think you can charge into fight after fight on a 'feeling' and keep walking away?\"   \n\n\"Isn't that the idea?

Have you considered that?\" \n\n\"This coming from the gung-ho Ghost, taking on the whole Hive army with a set of shaving razors.\" Sloane chuckled to herself. \"Seriously, are you expecting to live through… whatever this is?\" \n\n\"No,\" Síocháin said meekly. \"I hoped you would.\" \n\nThe firm lines of Sloane's expression crumbled for an instant. \n\nThis was unlike them. \n\nShe shut her visor, cleared her throat, and turned to continue marching. \"No more fighting, for you. That's an order.\" \n\n\"But that's—I was saying that to you!\" The Ghost zipped forward. \"Hey! Don't walk away from me!\" \n\nSloane stopped. The heavy metal around her boots sank into the silty sea floor. \"I'm not—there's NOWHERE to walk away TO! That's MY point!\" Sloane jabbed a finger at her Ghost.  \n\n\"I'm not starving to death for an eternity just to turn out like the psycho that runs Gambit… if I even make it that far. But you don't have to worry about that. Let me be useful while I can.

Zavala had expected the silence that followed to be equally familiar, even companionable.  \n\nThe truth was apparent in the abrasive passage of each minute. The faint sense memory of ozone in his nostrils. The gulf between them had merely shifted in quality: deep, not wide.  \n\nZavala set the datapad aside. \"Sloane.

She dragged a hand through methane fluid to her faceplate, absentmindedly trying to rub the grogginess from her eyes.  \n\nMotion in the dark surrounding her kicked up clouds of fine grit.  \n\nHer headlights flared as her fingertips clinked against her helmet—a Thrall came screaming into the beam of light, bubbles spewing from its jaws. Sloane's eyes went wide before she reflexively flipped the Thrall over her shoulder and kicked its jaw through its skull. Her power suit spooled and pushed stimulants reactively. \n\nShe pivoted and caught the sword of a Knight mid-swing, snapping the weapon in two between the fingers of her gauntlet and driving a shard of broken blade into its chest. Another Thrall crossed her headlights just before a silver streak whistled through its throat. Sloane eyed a selection in her visor, which hi-lighted over thirty dead Hive, slowly deteriorating in boils of tiny, rumbling ignitions that sent nerve-spasms through their husks. Her visor cleared the readings and snapped onto a friendly.  \n\nSíocháin drifted forward, Hive viscera gently wafting into the sea from the slender razors protruding from her shell. \"You were out for days.\" \n\nSloane's face wrinkled in confusion. \"I remember the Pyramid wave. Falling… dreams. Are you okay?\" \n\n\"Hive found us, like you said,\" Síocháin said, retracting her blades. \n\nSloane grabbed the Ghost and hugged her to her power suit chassis for a moment. \"Little killer. Really gave 'em the business.\" \n\nSíocháin chirped. \"Pyramid wave swept over Titan, bounced around a bit and centralized where the Pyramid stopped. Gravity went crazy, then the ocean. I think we're a few miles from where we were when all this started.\" \n\n\"The Pyramid stopped? Then that's where we're headed… after we grab some gear,\" Sloane said. \n\nSíocháin dipped forward. \"One more thing. Something's out there circling us. Not Hive. Can't quite pin it down, but it's big.\" \n\n\"Yeah?\" Sloane said, thinking of what went through her mind before she lost consciousness. \"Then let's not waste any time getting out of here.\" \n\n*** \n\nSloane lifted herself from the ocean onto a half-submerged Arcology platform where she'd stowed a variety of rations and munitions since Titan's skies went dark. Her power suit clattered against the steel-mesh floor; she waited for the echoes to die down before taking a moment to exhale in silence. In that quiet moment, she made out a faint voice.  \n\nSíocháin rose into view. \"Do you hear that?\" \n\n\"Was about to ask you…\" Sloane said, standing. She snatched First In, Last Out from a stow locker, racked the foregrip, then followed the voice down a barnacle-crusted causeway to an old research lab with Síocháin in tow. \n\nFluid trickled down cracked walls surrounding rows of dead monitors. Glass reflected prismatic color from a gnarled tear in reality at the lab's center—as if it had been carved from another epoch and affixed to this one.  \n\nA Human that didn't seem to notice them paced within the tear—standing in a fully functioning mirage of the Arcology. Once he turned toward them, the tear spasmed and lurched forward and backward in time at erratic durations and speed. He was ripped both ways into non-existence as the tear flittered through events like a fourth-dimensional montage. \n\nThe tear held steady again, returning the man and his moment to existence. Síocháin took note of the badge on his coat that read \"Gideon Tepin—NPA—Senior Marine Biologist.\" \n\nTepin looked upset and turned away before speaking. \"She's afraid. That's why we're all having them. Something's wrong. She's showing us what's coming in plain view!\" The man angrily swiped his hand through the air in Sloane's direction. \"It's like she's screaming it into my head. I know I'm not the only one hearing it.\"  \n\n\"It chose us.\" He stepped forward and placed his hand on the border between then and now. \"I'm dreaming my own memories, but with little differences. Little omens. Black ships in the sky.\" \n\nSloane leaned forward, hand nearly pressed to that of the living memory playing out before her on the other side of the tear. \n\n\"She's trying to warn us. We should evacuate. We have to get her—\" \n\nThe tear lurched again, ripped away; lost to the rushing passage of time and blinked into non-existence. Gone. \n\nSloane dropped her hand. Jaw clenched. \"See if you can dig up any Arcology records on this.\" \n\n*** \n\n\"That marine biologist… Tepin… was he in some sort of captured time fluctuation? Is that… even possible?\" Sloane asked. \n\n\"I've never seen anything like it,\" Síocháin said. \"I'm not really sure.\" \n\nSíocháin skimmed archived reports. \"It's under 'TLev-01.' Looks like a psychic space whale some biologists were studying out in the ocean. They never got accurate measurements, but this estimate can't be correct. Over 150 meters?

Not a lot of alien species in Sol until after the Golden Age.\" \n\n\"I was having dreams while I was out, Síocháin. Of some other world, the Pyramid on Titan… the Tower. Like I remembered being there for each one.\" \n\n\"Well, I guess it could be an ancient space whale… or sometimes the Traveler gives people dreams. But are we going to ignore the obvious 'you were rendered unconscious by a Pyramid wave' explanation?\" \n\n\"No… but we've seen enough weird not to knock it,\" Sloane sighed.  \n\n\"Sure. I'll log that away,\" Síocháin said. \"You know… the readings coming from inside that field Tepin was in were consistent with atmospheric records on Titan during the Collapse.\" \n\n\"What does that mean?\" Sloane looked back to the spot of warped space-time. \"Was he… real?\" \n\n\"I don't know.

With it, a lifetime: every experienced moment in a slurry of vivid flashes, condensed into simultaneous chaotic anarchy, grasping at grief, joy, anger, love. Seen from where she stood, past experiences gained new perspectives; memories best left dusted with rosy haze shrank under harsh light. Warmth, too fleeting, cold, still, ever frigid in its isolation…  \n\nAnd something else, sifting through it all, drawing it to order, as if rearranging fractured collagic panes into a new image.  \n\nShe struggled to breathe, and her suit flexed against the weight of her years, splayed out across time in violating fashion. Then just as suddenly, they were gone, faded into dreams.  \n\nThe sky turned black and orange like a fire-screen, and thunder resonated. \n\nSloane's body pitched forward over the platform, sinking through air, then sea. Heavy metal was swallowed whole; consciousness faded into the black. \n\nHer experience tumbled through sharded eras of reality like an astral projection, even as she felt her feet still firmly planted in the present. A cascade of timeless scenes whirled by, like panes of life captured in glass, in an indefinite stream of consciousness. Scenes of Titan, of a vibrant seascape installation. Too familiar not to be memories. \n\nNot hers, but no less real. \n\nTheir point of focus left Titan, dragged backwards across the lonely expanse of space to a world she'd never seen.  \n\nIts seas full of vivacious promise. Its moons conceal a Watcher in the sky. Its waves breed insidious appetite in the deep. \n\nThere is a temptation there she craves but does not understand. Unnatural and cursed. \n\nShe fell again, guided. Through a song, a memory, an image of a dream bent into perception like a focusing lens. Unreality coated in familiar skin. An attempt at understanding. \n\nThe Tower. Friends and comrades. Shine and grime, all. A heralded return. A shadow drawn overhead. A battle delayed, returning. \n\nThe Tower, a time yet lived. Black shadows that would fill an empty void in the sky, extending impaling blades down into the streets. Pinning life in paralytic mockeries of contentment. A display that strangles agency. \n\nA serpent winds a path beneath the shadow and offers to guide.  \n\nShe remembered this happening, and that it had not yet happened.","icon":null}},"3408724267":{"hash":3408724267,"index":2326,"redacted":false,"name":null,"iconImagePath":null,"colorImagePath":null,"displayProperties":{"name":"The Friends We Made","description":"Over the years, our relationship to both Light and Darkness has changed.

It leaves behind an impossible data fragment to mark its passing.\n\nHere is what a flower knows.\n\n(The fact that a flower may know anything is a conceit that will have to be accepted as metaphor, but to constantly qualify into perfect precision wears thin, does it not? So, here is what a collection of chloroplasts and pigment can know.)\n\nThe direction of the sun.\n\nThe presence of the rain.\n\nThe tangle of the roots.\n\nThe distress of another plant.\n\nThe hands of the gardener, whether they prune or transplant or crush.\n\nA flower cannot know much else. But the reality of the garden is vast and wild. A flower knows not the fence; a flower knows not the footpath. And yet there is an infinite cosmic garden, which is not any less real simply because the flower cannot possibly comprehend it…\n\nLet us try this again. Stop me if you've heard this one: A gardener and a winnower sit down to play a game outside of time and creation. Yes?\n\nYes. Then we're agreed. The metaphor stands. Let us iterate.\n\nA gardener and a winnower set out their chairs and play a game of flowers. The flowers know only that they grow or wither, struggle or flourish. Sometimes, they are touched by one hand or the other, and that influence is the closest they will know of the divine.\n\nA flower and a flower spread their leaves to the sun above. (Remember that the sun is also a metaphor: a thing said beautifully, winnowed down to poetry, when the truth is too vast to put in words at all.) They jostle for space, each competing to be the pinnacle of their shape. One flourishes. One withers. Is it the fault of the flower or the fault of its position?\n\nA gardener and a winnower sit down to play a game called Possibility. This is a game about a garden, which is to say that it is also a game about flowers, just as a game about a living being must also be a game about organs and bacteria.\n\nA gardener and a winnower collaborate to create a protein. Whose hand is it in the design, that shortens one life to extend the rest?\n\nIt is the winnower that discovers the first knife, but it is not done without the gardener. This, too, is a tradition: a knife does not come to exist without something that must be cut. A woody stem, a colored petal, a vital vessel. The first victims of the blade.\n\nAll of these are true.\n\nAll of these are false, for metaphor simplifies as the knife does. It pares incalculable concepts into shapes your wrinkly little brains can comprehend. The weight of billions and the simple curve of a planet give you pause, and how then are you to be expected to grasp the forces that created your nth-removed creator?\n\nSo the stories woven with utmost delicacy in and around the falsehoods are, after it all, true. There was never any option for the knife to not exist in the garden: it was only ever a matter of time and opportunity.\n\nAnd as for the shape of the knife itself—\n\nNo. That is enough.\n\nI will tell you of gardens.\n\nThey are domesticated things, made in a form. As soon as something is called a garden, it is shaped. The plants require the hand of a gardener, for they have become weak and dependent on tender care. They require the hand of a winnower, to cut away the dross, for they are too incapable to do it themselves. In absence of a hand, either the flowers themselves must rise up to wield the knife, or the garden will resolve to meaningless wilderness.\n\nYou will say, \"But there are plants that can walk! There are seeds that must be scorched by fire to know growth! Existence is more complex than a simple dichotomy between growth and withering, and there is more in heaven and on earth than is dreamt of in this philosophy!\"\n\nAnd I will tell you, clearly:\n\nThere can be no gardens without knives.","icon":"/common/destiny2_content/icons/12b788b318336be608cb0d11de311ad0.png"}},"3499056977":{"hash":3499056977,"index":2425,"redacted":false,"name":null,"iconImagePath":null,"colorImagePath":null,"displayProperties":{"name":"NPA \"Weir-Walker\" Cloak","description":"Sloane knelt, unable to stand.

Eruptions of soulfire swallowed the Terrace and branched through the methane as the projection imploded on itself. The serpent dove, its enormous form overtaking and dwarfing the crumbling Terrace projection. It twisted above them, unfurling a portion of its tail to sweep aside scores of Hive with ease and sending plumes of sediment into a thick, obfuscating fog.  \n\nSloane collapsed, and Síocháin rushed to her side, cutting through an Acolyte before it could raise its shredder. \"We need to go! Get up!\" Síocháin exclaimed and began stitching Sloane's gushing wounds and mending bones where she could. All around them, the Hive fired wildly into the sea, the soulfire pops of their deaths spurring tiny, muted explosions as it reacted with liquid methane.  \n\nBefore Síocháin could get Sloane to her feet, the serpent slammed down in front of them, belly first, and shielded them from retaliatory Hive salvos. Síocháin darted in front of Sloane, razors ready against this giant beast, but the serpent simply looked at the Titan, its massive eye spanning more than three of her, shoulder to shoulder.

That's an order.\" \n\n\"But that's—I was saying that to you!\" The Ghost zipped forward. \"Hey! Don't walk away from me!\" \n\nSloane stopped. The heavy metal around her boots sank into the silty sea floor. \"I'm not—there's NOWHERE to walk away TO!

Together with her Ghost, she'd chased the Pyramid's signals across Titan, but arrived too late at each coordinate site. They'd encountered nothing more than further wounds in the fabric of reality; slivered glimpses into moments held in Titan's memory. Occasionally, discarded Shrieker cores littered a site—evidence of a ritual gone cold, but not so cold that Síocháin couldn't detect figments of resonant residue that drove her scanners haywire. \n\nMore than once, Sloane had found a clutch of disoriented Fallen scattered around these wounds, some in a stupor, most driven violently mad. Síocháin said their brain patterns were fractured—synapses burnt into conflicting circuited loops—as if their collection of experiences had been dissected and left disparate and apart.  \n\nBut Sloane felt drawn, across the barren seafloor, to each new site shrouded in sunless shadow. Something cut through that Dark. Guided her. As if she drafted behind a rogue wave. \n\n\"We're almost to the next site,\" Síocháin said. \n\n\"Let's pick it up.\" The methane flowed over Sloane's armor in a slick, slipstream current that left a long tail of particulate floating in her wake, agitated by oxygen bubbles spurting from her mask. Síocháin followed close behind, sweeping the area with light beams that dissipated over vast, featureless depths. \n\n\"Resonant Pyramid energy, neutrino dispersals, and some kind of… quantum entangling? That's the best I can make of it,\" Síocháin said, razor blades deployed. \"The Pyramid's moving again.\"  \n\n*** \n\nThe site seemed quiet on the surface. Sloane glanced over a sea cliff and tapped Síocháin, who had been leering out at the expansive of dark ocean as if she was tracking something.  \n\n\"You ready?\"  \n\nThe Ghost turned to Sloane and hesitantly tilted her shell into a nod. \n\nThey killed their lights, allowing the bio-luminescent coral around them to illuminate the path down to a newly split-open gorge infested with Taken corruption. Sloane swapped her visor to a thermal targeting overlay and slipped over the edge of the chasm. Tendrils of Taken malignance flowed from the split ground beneath her, dancing in the methane like noxious filaments. The fissure looked large enough for her to finagle her suit through safely.  \n\nSloane glanced over her shoulder and held up a hand to Síocháin. \"Watch my back… from a distance.\" \n\n\"Uh, no. I can fight,\" she bit back defiantly. \"Fallen, Hive, and Taken are all over this sector.\" \n\n\"Lie low on this one. If something goes wrong, it can't go wrong with you. Get me?\" \n\nShe landed in a small cavern where a tangle of Taken threads writhed around a decrepit Hive sigil of resilient witchcraft. Whispers spewed from the sigil, wrapped around her mind, coaxed her forward. She reached a hand toward the sigil, and methane burst around her like depth charges as Taken blights manifested a small detachment of soldiers. \n\nSloane spun, her fists crackling with lightning—her fingers weaving her Arc Light safely through the methane around her. She charged the first of three blights, thruster-dodging incoming fire pinged by her HUD. She broke through the blight screen, planted her feet, and threw a lightning punch like a gauss cannon, atomizing the Taken and the blight itself. Her power suit carried her fulgurate fists from hostile to hostile in rising, truculent battle-fervor. \n\nWhen the cavern quieted, Sloane turned back to the sigil and called Síocháin down. \"I can… hear the Taken through this sigil… thing. It's like they're broadcasting out loud. Not in words but… their proximity, like sonar. Can you tap into it?\" \n\nSíocháin's concerned response was muffled by an intrusive thought echoing from somewhere far off, circling the sea around her and draining off into her mind. \n\n|Take| \n\n|Live| \n\nSloane thought of the ocean shelves crawling with the Pyramid's minions, their rituals and corruption sinking deeper into Titan's mantle by the day. Of the armies they threatened to summon, of what they searched for in the deep. \n\nShe thought of the Fallen who had no way to flee, shocked into madness by the reality-wounding waves that swept over Titan like a grey-matter line. A terminator of experience, via suspension within it. With this foreknowledge of her enemies' plans, maybe she could be a step ahead of dusk. \n\n|Take| \n\n |Live| \n\nSloane stepped forward, dazed—her mind drowning in the ocean's dangers—and gripped the sigil. The rippling Taken energy immediately backfired in a blinding burst of energy. \n\n\"No!\" Síocháin dove forward in horror as Taken tendrils twisted around Sloane's armor and dragged her to the ground.  \n\n\"SLOANE!\" \n\nAs tendrils buried themselves into her flesh, Sloane heard a new voice, clear as sirens in a storm. \n \nWARRIOR OF THE SKY.  \n\nYOU ARE KNOWN TO ME.  \n\nI ACCEPT YOUR CHALLENGE.","icon":null}},"3722748537":{"hash":3722748537,"index":2441,"redacted":true,"name":null,"iconImagePath":null,"colorImagePath":null,"displayProperties":{"name":"Classified","description":"Keep it secret.

She glances at the memorial, then stands.  \n\n\"Please, leave me be.\" \n\n\"My name is Sister Faora,\" the robed woman continues. \"Devotee of Osiris, Seeker of Truth. Outcast.\" The last title earns a squint from Shayura. \n\n\"What do you want, Outcast Faora?\" \n\nSister Faora gestures to herself with one hand. \"Only to offer you something that few others would, given your history.\" \n\nShayura raises a brow in challenge. Faora boldly meets it. \n\n\"Friendship.\"","icon":null}},"4017272394":{"hash":4017272394,"index":2414,"redacted":false,"name":null,"iconImagePath":null,"colorImagePath":null,"displayProperties":{"name":"Deepseeker Shell","description":"\"It seems intact,\" a voice chirps in the dark. \n\nA Ghost and their Guardian sit in an idle jumpship orbiting Neptune. The swirling cerulean hemisphere dominates the cockpit's right field of view, the rest blanketed by the gulf of space, speckled with the remains of another jumpship. \n\n\"Should… should we boot it up?\" \n\nThe Guardian holds a datapad, the battered case adorned with Vanguard designs. Their Ghost peers over their shoulder at the only surviving piece of hardware they could salvage from the wreckage. That, and the shards of another Guardian's Ghost, respectfully arranged on the console. \n\n\"Whatever's in that device might be important,\" the Ghost urges in curiosity, more than anything else.  \n\nThe Guardian gives in and turns on the datapad. After a cursory review, they find no field reports, no mission briefings. Nothing but page after page of…  \n\nWriting. Fiction, essays… poems. A huge collection of works, decades of material, all penned by the lost Guardian. \n\n\"This Guardian… she'd invented her own fictional universe. It must have meant so much to her to keep as closely as she did. A personal space to share thoughts without fear of judgment.\" The Ghost's assessment is analytical but bordering on the emotional core of the discovery. With a soft, sad beep, the Ghost looks at their Guardian and sinks down to the datapad. \n\n\"This is a piece of who she was. Personal truths.\" The Ghost muses, as if on the verge of a greater understanding. \"Maybe… maybe through her stories, she lives on. Maybe… that's the same for all of us.\" \n\nThe Guardian says nothing and begins to read.","icon":null}},"4024394434":{"hash":4024394434,"index":2325,"redacted":false,"name":null,"iconImagePath":null,"colorImagePath":null,"displayProperties":{"name":"The Leaders Who Guide Us","description":"The Vanguard is the Last City's greatest defense and first line of offense when a threat presents itself. The organization is comprised of a long, storied line of elite Guardians with a leader chosen for each of the classes: Hunter, Titan, and Warlock.\n\nCommander Zavala serves as Titan Vanguard. A force of nature, as unyielding as he is deadly. He has led the Guardians to victory in countless battles, and the moment a threat presents itself, the Last City looks to him as both a leader and a protector.\n \nIkora Rey serves as the Warlock Vanguard. An unmatched scholar, and one of the most formidable Warlocks in the history of the Last City. She oversees the Vanguard's intelligence network known as The Hidden.\n\nCurrently, the Hunter Vanguard position remains open. The title once belonged to Cayde-6, a Guardian as quick with a gun as he was with a joke. He met his final death after his Ghost was killed—a sobering reminder that even Guardians can be slain. A statue of him stands in the Tower to keep his memory alive.","icon":"/common/destiny2_content/icons/7a9e6a6f3d0ddcdf4eecb5f69ffd1efd.png"}},"4066778670":{"hash":4066778670,"index":2400,"redacted":false,"name":null,"iconImagePath":null,"colorImagePath":null,"displayProperties":{"name":"Thin Precipice","description":"Kelgorath kneels before a feeble altar in an empty court. A dead Knight's realm. A shriveled, fleshless rind. A cautionary tale. \n\nA Wizard floats over the altar. \"The High Celebrant's domain was once a grand place of adoration. It holds a mighty tribute.\" The Wizard, Rakthrin, War-Council, whispers Xivu Arath's bait to the Knight. \n\nKelgorath remembers how Savathûn sought the Sky and became its puppet, all so she could usurp sword logic. \"Favor wanes. It can be rekindled.\" \n\n\"You were disarmed. Shamed. Beaten so many times by a Light-wielder.\" \n\nKelgorath stands, spinning to face Rakthrin. He thrusts a claw forward at the Wizard's throat, but she swoops back from his reach.  \n\nKelgorath sneers. \"I need no blade; I am wielded. The plates upon my body are razors.\" \n\n\"Should you have remained with Savathûn and prayed to her to give you the Light… perhaps you would have found greatness then. You wither without her favor.\" \n\n\"I spit on the Witch Sister! I am an instrument of War!\" \n\n\"Not yet. Not truly.\" \n\nRakthrin conjures a dark bolt of lightning that saps the room's dim lighting and casts it into the altar. The altar splits apart with a timbered snap, revealing an emerald sliver of a blade, bleeding shade and whispering rapture. \"A shard of the Taken King's blade. Conquered out of love. Stolen away from Saturn's shadow.\" \n\nKelgorath fixates upon the blade shard. The Wizard gestures to it with a lipless smile, and the Knight steps forward.\n\n\"I will take it.

She groaned as she awkwardly missed the distant ledge she sought and instead drifted slowly into the blackness below.\n\nShe reached out for purchase along the side of the chasm, but her gloves met only the fleshy cilia of the egregore. She recoiled—egregore fungus in the Ascendant Plane?—but then sank her hands deep into the stuff to slow her fall. She came to rest on a boulder, caught unsteadily in a clump of writhing fungus.\n\nDruis squinted up through the darkness. Waving egregore fronds bobbed into her field of vision and she pushed them aside. She brought the sleeve of her green velvet robe to her mouth, trying in vain not to inhale the cloud of foul spores that hissed steadily from the fungal pods.\n\nShe focused herself. \"C'mon, Queensguard,\" she muttered. \"You can do this.\" She thought of Queen Mara and concentrated her Light beneath her, forcing herself upward to—\n\nA pervasive whispering pushed into her mind as a sticky tendril brushed against her arm. She swatted it back and focused again.\n\nShe thought of the prisoners languishing within the Pyramid outposts, innocents who needed—\n\nA wet pileus flopped onto her boots, thrumming with terrible memories. She kicked it away with a snarl and thought of her allies, those she'd helped and been helped by along her journey—\n\nThe stone shifted beneath her as the Ascendant Plane rearranged itself with a lurch. She looked up as the egregore on the sides of the abyss began to intertwine, sealing her in.\n\nThere was a cold shock of fear… then rage. I will not die here, she thought. Not in this place. I will not be food for this creeping filth. I—\n\nDruis thought of herself.\n\nHer Light flashed upward, cutting through the nothingness, and touched the favor of the Awoken.\n\nSpirals of tiny purple crystals sprouted from the ground beneath her boots. The shifting stone she stood on locked in place, fused into an amethyst mass.\n\nAn egregore pod wavering inches from her face froze, crystal encrusted, like a piece of sugared fruit. It bent heavily, then snapped under its own weight and shattered on the ground.\n\nDruis wreathed her Light around herself. The egregore on the side of the chasm recoiled as if burned, revealing handholds of bare, clean stone.\n\nShe nodded, tightened her sash, and began the arduous climb back to the top.","icon":null}}},"previousDefinitions":{},"otherDefinitions":{},"tableDiff":{"added":[42941848,90009855,322717029,409820272,426260446,431605328,457617725,493786073,540625098,542573208,587762963,726878794,748663978,839786290,896458489,940371471,967777908,1063769568,1081724548,1123421440,1125217994,1279846187,1441805468,1685051367,1757202961,1769847435,1853085236,1869778952,1912669214,1961182320,2007908580,2213223388,2274944459,2324998093,2363472582,2374129871,2386078741,2400549110,2664281431,2733403573,2797536515,2883484461,2966283697,2977663932,2978918436,3016891299,3093309525,3135336191,3262192268,3321971888,3332065301,3499056977,3513993870,3607600504,3722748537,3825487416,3825487417,3825487418,3825487421,3825487422,3825487423,3890055324,3895393355,4005780578,4017272394,4066778670],"unclassified":[962579774,1398645392,1398645394,1398645395,1398645396,1398645397,1398645398,1398645399,1398645400,1398645401,1459720646,2286676114,2839921974,2859797930,3007800920,3007800921,3007800923,3030405822,3408724267,3429296256,4024394434],"removed":[],"reclassified":[],"modified":[164103153,428806571,840487990,988330314,1089162050,1159113819,1903444925,1968283192,2549387168,2598029856,3031934630,3056490591,3312368357,3995603239,4290220099]},"tableDiffSummary":{"added":66,"unclassified":21,"removed":0,"reclassified":0,"modified":15},"tableName":"DestinyLoreDefinition","missingTable":false,"versionDiffSummary":{"DestinyArtDyeReferenceDefinition":{"added":571,"unclassified":0,"removed":0,"reclassified":0,"modified":0},"DestinyActivityDefinition":{"added":92,"unclassified":0,"removed":79,"reclassified":0,"modified":349},"DestinyActivityTypeDefinition":{"added":0,"unclassified":0,"removed":0,"reclassified":0,"modified":1},"DestinyUnlockDefinition":{"added":1767,"unclassified":0,"removed":2086,"reclassified":0,"modified":0},"DestinySandboxPerkDefinition":{"added":92,"unclassified":0,"removed":17,"reclassified":0,"modified":35},"DestinyStatGroupDefinition":{"added":0,"unclassified":0,"removed":0,"reclassified":0,"modified":2},"DestinyProgressionMappingDefinition":{"added":2,"unclassified":0,"removed":0,"reclassified":0,"modified":0},"DestinyFactionDefinition":{"added":1,"unclassified":0,"removed":0,"reclassified":0,"modified":0},"DestinyUnlockValueDefinition":{"added":726,"unclassified":0,"removed":109,"reclassified":0,"modified":0},"DestinyRewardMappingDefinition":{"added":629,"unclassified":0,"removed":109,"reclassified":0,"modified":0},"DestinyRewardSheetDefinition":{"added":328,"unclassified":0,"removed":49,"reclassified":0,"modified":0},"DestinyActivityGraphDefinition":{"added":0,"unclassified":0,"removed":0,"reclassified":0,"modified":6},"DestinyActivityInteractableDefinition":{"added":2,"unclassified":0,"removed":0,"reclassified":0,"modified":0},"DestinyCollectibleDefinition":{"added":322,"unclassified":0,"removed":114,"reclassified":0,"modified":120},"DestinyDestinationDefinition":{"added":1,"unclassified":0,"removed":0,"reclassified":0,"modified":0},"DestinyEntitlementOfferDefinition":{"added":40,"unclassified":0,"removed":0,"reclassified":0,"modified":0},"DestinyInventoryItemDefinition":{"added":1291,"unclassified":0,"removed":139,"reclassified":0,"modified":16190},"DestinyLocationDefinition":{"added":34,"unclassified":0,"removed":0,"reclassified":0,"modified":1},"DestinyLoreDefinition":{"added":66,"unclassified":21,"removed":0,"reclassified":0,"modified":15},"DestinyMaterialRequirementSetDefinition":{"added":0,"unclassified":0,"removed":0,"reclassified":0,"modified":14},"DestinyMetricDefinition":{"added":10,"unclassified":0,"removed":0,"reclassified":0,"modified":4},"DestinyObjectiveDefinition":{"added":894,"unclassified":0,"removed":132,"reclassified":0,"modified":176},"DestinyPlugSetDefinition":{"added":115,"unclassified":0,"removed":0,"reclassified":0,"modified":1690},"DestinyPresentationNodeDefinition":{"added":70,"unclassified":0,"removed":19,"reclassified":0,"modified":1567},"DestinyProgressionDefinition":{"added":7,"unclassified":0,"removed":0,"reclassified":0,"modified":8},"DestinyRecordDefinition":{"added":274,"unclassified":10,"removed":125,"reclassified":0,"modified":161},"DestinyRewardItemListDefinition":{"added":330,"unclassified":0,"removed":45,"reclassified":0,"modified":0},"DestinySackRewardItemListDefinition":{"added":261,"unclassified":0,"removed":38,"reclassified":0,"modified":0},"DestinySandboxPatternDefinition":{"added":48,"unclassified":0,"removed":0,"reclassified":0,"modified":2},"DestinySeasonDefinition":{"added":0,"unclassified":0,"removed":0,"reclassified":0,"modified":15},"DestinySeasonPassDefinition":{"added":1,"unclassified":0,"removed":0,"reclassified":0,"modified":0},"DestinySocketCategoryDefinition":{"added":0,"unclassified":0,"removed":0,"reclassified":0,"modified":3},"DestinySocketTypeDefinition":{"added":14,"unclassified":0,"removed":1,"reclassified":0,"modified":0},"DestinyTraitDefinition":{"added":106,"unclassified":0,"removed":88,"reclassified":0,"modified":0},"DestinyUnlockC
