This high up, the wind pulls at her cape, beckoning her farther along. \n\nThe streets below throng with celebrants. The Awoken among them—Earthborn, Reefborn, Lightbearers—all gleam twilight in Mara's mind. \n\nThe celebrations tonight are for the City; Mara has no wish to make herself a place in them. Instead, she walks alone and thinks to her first Night of Ascents. \n\nIt had trickled upwards to Mara from her people; a folk holiday that eventually turned into an institution. It took decades to settle into its current form: a journey through the dark on the anniversary of the Awoken exodus from the Distributary. \n\nOn that first night, Sjur had blown in like a breeze, banging the door open, equipped as always with sturdy boots and her longbow, ready to bully her queen outdoors. She had led Mara by the hand, laughing, and laughing Mara had let her. \n\nAs they walked, Sjur's were the strides of a tall woman used to outdoor work. Mara had the pace of a leader who primarily focused on cognitive action. The difference often slipped Sjur's mind. \n\n\"Slow down,\" Mara had said, as they neared the gates of the Watchtower. \n\n\"I could carry you.\" \n\n\"Don't,\" Mara retorted—too hastily, not stern enough to put off a woman like Sjur Eido. \n\nMara hurried through the gate before she could be picked up, Sjur lunging after her shouting, \"But my queen, my heart's calling is to serve you!\" \n\nThe night continued on as they walked the asteroids side by side through space's endless night, reliving memories of that first journey to the Reef: escaping the missiles that followed them through the wormhole. The giddy adrenaline and cool calculation needed to make it to their new home.  \n\nDespite the cold of the thin air, Sjur radiated warmth—enormous, laughing, alive. It was Sjur's hand on hers that Mara remembered most in later years. One moment tugging Mara towards a climb; the next, supporting Mara through a gully like the most courtly of knights. \n\nFor many years, it was Sjur at her side during the Night of Ascents. Other years Uldren, eager to show Mara some new vista, some ancient treasures along the way. Twice Riven, inspecting their masterwork together on long walks through the Dreaming City. \n\nIn the Reef and the Dreaming City, Mara's people celebrate together. Remember their history. Enact it, making it new, returning it to life. \n\nNow, she watches over the Awoken below, celebrating another holiday in a City with traditions of its own. \n\nAnd Mara walks alone, between the City and the dark outside.","icon":null}},"386385208":{"hash":386385208,"index":2588,"redacted":false,"name":null,"iconImagePath":null,"colorImagePath":null,"displayProperties":{"name":"Wyrmguard Greaves","description":"[Report by VanNet encrypted router.] \n\n[E-Morn//Link: NM-O01] \n\n[Msg-Archive//00192410] \n\nE-Morn: Your findings are consistent with mine.

This wish is granted through invocation of something known as the \"Anthem Anatheme,\" which appears to be a manner of subjecting reality to one's will, similar to a Lightbearer's ability to affect paracausality. However, little is known about how this process unfolds in practice. \n\nHenceforth, the \"wisher\" enters a binding contract with the Ahamkara, though many Ahamkara will purposefully manipulate or misinterpret the parameters of this contract to draw greater nourishment from it, often causing calamity to the wisher. \n\nLightbearers are expected to refrain from expressing wants or desires in the presence of an Ahamkara. \n\nVERIFIED: \n\n-Ahamkara bones somehow retain intelligence, sentience, and a manner of speech yet to be defined, post-mortem. It is surmised that an Ahamkara's corporeal body is not its true form, but a representation. \n-Ahamkara feed by granting wishes. These beings possess an innate ability to alter reality and consume the quantum chaos that results from such an act. This is theorized to allow them to \"transcend reality\". \n-Above information regarding altering reality supported by data confirming species-wide capability to shift form into a wide variety of living and inanimate structures.  \n-Wishes, while seemingly less potent and more difficult to initiate, are still able to be granted from Ahamkara bones. \n-Ahamkara are not solitary creatures. Many adults patrol vast distances across Sol alone, but their territories overlap, and disputes are rare. While Ahamkara do not typically hunt in packs, there have been sightings of hunting pairs. In fact, they do not appear to prey on each other at all. In one report, a dozen Ahamkara on Venus had congregated at a nexus of their territories without conflict.  \n\nUNVERIFIED: \n\n-Three reports from Old Russian claim Ahamkara wielded the Light. This has never been confirmed. \n-Seven Ahamkara that evaded and slew their Lightbearer pursuers and are still unaccounted for. This report is believed to be an error in its totality.","icon":null}},"469031127":{"hash":469031127,"index":2587,"redacted":false,"name":null,"iconImagePath":null,"colorImagePath":null,"displayProperties":{"name":"Wyrmguard Helm","description":"Descending the grassy sands of the Strand, Petra Venj hears the familiar roar of the Dreaming City, caught in another predictable brawl.

I did not mean their command over Strand or Stasis, but rather the deep, ancient corruption that empowers our enemies and corrodes our very souls. This force—this evil, if I may use such a simplistic term—surrounds us, and we must do all we can to limit our exposure, lest we find ourselves sinking below its dark waves.\n\nAnd so it was with great hesitancy that I examined the unusual \"Acolyte's Staff\" created by Eris Morn and Immaru, the renegade Ghost. I find their alliance baffling as she holds no love for the Hive, and he is the foul creature who resurrected Savathûn. But even that is not as strange as the staff itself.\n\nIn addition to being bound with charms and inscribed with powerful runes, the staff contains a small fragment of Hive worm. Due to a ghastly ritual and a metaphysical loophole in sword logic philosophy, a Guardian wielding the staff is able to transfer the power of their defeated foes to Ms. Morn through a blood tithe.\n\nSeeking answers, I sought Ms. Morn herself. I found her beyond a portal she erected in the H.E.L.M. She was waiting on an elaborate bone dais in a forgotten corner of Savathûn's throne world she called the Athenaeum, as it allowed her to study the secrets of Savathûn's Spire. The seclusion of the locale was appealing, but when Ms. Morn began to \"change,\" I fled, leaving my curiosity behind me.\n\nThere is power within the staff, Commander. Terrible power.\n\nSpeak to me not of the Darkness.\n\n—Master Rahool","icon":null}},"2504786634":{"hash":2504786634,"index":2597,"redacted":false,"name":null,"iconImagePath":null,"colorImagePath":null,"displayProperties":{"name":"Nostos","description":"Eramis anchored her Ketch on the shadowed side of an asteroid and cut the engines. She gazed out the viewport at a wrecked House of Wolves Ketch lying half-buried under the rubble of the Tangled Shore.  \n\nHer reverie was broken by Kylaksis, her lieutenant. \"Eramiskel. Your plan is working,\" the Vandal chittered gleefully. \"A Reef patrol is inbound, sweeping for nests. If we board them quickly, we can take the ship intact.\" \n\n\"No,\" Eramis replied, still gazing out the viewport. \"Let them pass.\"  \n\n\"It's a Corsair patrol vessel,\" Kylaksis insisted, his chitters staccato with frustration. \"Even as scrap, it's worth—\" \n\n\"LET THEM PASS,\" Eramis thundered, whirling to face the Vandal. \"The time of The Shipstealer has gone.\"  \n\n\"All that matters now,\" Eramis said, \"is where we are when the end arrives.\" The Kell of Darkness activated her transmat, leaving a frustrated Kylaksis alone on the bridge. \n\nEramis rematerialized in the wrecked House of Wolves Ketch. The walls of the ship were pitted by bullet holes and desiccated Hive growths; only Hive and Lightbearers had dared to enter since it was shot down during the Reef Wars. She shook her head. What a waste. \n\nShe stepped over Thrall and Acolyte corpses, picking her way carefully to the ship's navigation. Once inside, she opened an access panel and pulled out a centuries-old data core. She sifted through the archives until she found it: a detailed map of Riis, the Eliksni home world. \n\nIt was the same map that Eramis's mate, Athrys, had followed out of Sol. It even included the habitable zones she'd tabbed as potential landing sites. \n\nBy now, Athrys might be Kell of her own settlement, living happily alongside their grown hatchlings. Or they might all be long-dead. In truth, Eramis hadn't wondered at either possibility for decades. \n\nBut ever since she saw the Witness disappear into its portal, Eramis could think of little else. All her prior aspirations were made suddenly small. Eliksni solidarity, revenge against the Traveler, enmity with the Humans… they were all irrelevant.  \n\nIf a second Whirlwind was her fate, Eramis would suffer it as she had the first: with Athrys by her side.","icon":null}},"2558925366":{"hash":2558925366,"index":2556,"redacted":false,"name":null,"iconImagePath":null,"colorImagePath":null,"displayProperties":{"name":"Scatter Signal","description":"//NM:O-monitor-spike003… tracking… tracking… \n\n//NM:O-monitor-spike003… signal lead… signal lock… \n\n//NM:O-monitor-spike003… feed established… \n\n41 20 63 68 75 72 6e 69 6e 67 20 73 69 6e 67 75 6c 61 72 69 74 79 20 6f 66 20 73 68 61 64 6f 77 20 61 6e 64 20 6d 69 6d 69 63 72 79 20 62 65 61 74 73 20 61 67 61 69 6e 20 77 69 74 68 69 6e 20 63 75 6c 74 69 76 61 74 65 64 20 63 68 61 6f 73 2e 20 20 0d 0a 0d 0a 4d 69 6e 64 73 20 6f 72 62 69 74 20 69 74 73 20 67 72 61 76 69 74 79 2c 20 74 6f 20 62 72 69 64 67 65 20 63 6f 6d 6d 75 6e 69 6f 6e 20 77 69 74 68 20 61 20 56 6f 69 63 65 2c 20 74 6f 20 6d 6f 76 65 20 66 72 6f 6d 20 70 61 72 61 6c 6c 65 6c 20 74 6f 20 65 6e 74 61 6e 67 6c 65 6d 65 6e 74 2e 20 20 0d 0a 0d 0a 54 68 65 79 20 64 72 65 61 6d 20 6f 66 20 61 20 64 61 72 6b 20 63 6f 72 65 2c 20 63 6f 6e 74 61 69 6e 65 64 20 77 69 74 68 69 6e 20 61 20 74 69 6d 65 6c 65 73 73 20 73 74 72 75 63 74 75 72 65 2e 20 41 20 73 75 73 70 65 6e 64 65 64 20 72 65 74 75 72 6e 20 74 6f 20 74 68 65 20 70 72 69 6d 6f 72 64 69 61 6c 2e 20 0d 0a 0d 0a 49 66 20 6e 6f 74 20 66 6f 72 20 74 68 69 73 20 74 72 75 74 68 2c 20 77 68 79 20 6b 6e 65 65 6c 3f 20 49 66 20 6e 6f 74 20 66 6f 72 20 74 68 69 73 20 74 72 75 74 68 2c 20 77 68 79 20 64 6f 65 73 20 69 74 20 65 6c 75 64 65 20 64 65 66 69 6e 69 74 69 6f 6e 3f 20 20 0d 0a 0d 0a 54 68 6f 75 67 68 20 6e 6f 74 20 61 6c 6c 20 61 67 72 65 65 20 6f 6e 20 61 6c 6c 2c 20 61 6c 6c 20 61 67 72 65 65 20 6f 6e 20 74 68 69 73 2e 20 20 0d 0a 0d 0a 53 6f 6c 20 69 73 20 53 61 6c 76 61 74 69 6f 6e 2e 20","icon":null}},"2563668388":{"hash":2563668388,"index":2553,"redacted":false,"name":null,"iconImagePath":null,"colorImagePath":null,"displayProperties":{"name":"Scalar Potential","description":"// VANNET // EUROPA WIDEBAND // AudCHNL-2113-C // ENCRYPTION ENABLED \n// CRYPTARCHY ARCHIVE DELTA-4F // ANNOTATED // CLASSIFIED \n\n… \n\nEB: Is that everything, Commander? \n\nCZ: Well, no. There's one more thing. I wanted to ask you about Stasis. What it means for you to… wield the Darkness.  \n\nEB: I was wondering if you might ask me that. For me, Stasis is intimately tied to perception. And to time. \n\nCZ: Time? \n\nEB: Yes. Stasis has the power to slow molecular activity. A process that we normally associate with gravity. Relativity, and all that. \n\nCZ: You're talking about time dilation.  \n\nEB: Exactly. We think of time as… steady. But that's only because we experience it from a fixed perspective. When I \"freeze\" something with Stasis, I'm changing its timeframe relative to myself and the world around me. \n\nCZ: Stasis relies in part on one's perception of reality. Is that why Osiris always emphasizes self-control in using the Darkness? \n\nEB: That's his way of framing things. He views Stasis as exerting authority over oneself and others. \n\nCZ: And you don't? \n\nEB: In my view, the goal of Stasis is not to control the object, or even my own mind. It's to change my perspective. To see the object moving at the speed of my thoughts, not the speed of matter. \n\nCZ: And just… seeing it differently is enough? \n\nEB: Is that so hard to imagine? It's very similar to how you use Void Light—manipulating spacetime and gravitational fields. In fact, I would argue that Void has more in common with Stasis than it does with Solar or Arc. Perhaps they're reverse sides of the same coin. \n\nCZ: And using Stasis doesn't… worry you? Even after everything you've seen? \n\nEB: It did. For a long time, I feared that using Stasis would corrupt me, as I'd seen others corrupted. But after what seemed like a thousand years trapped in that interminable loop, it gradually dawned on me: the fear was the corruption. As long as fear gripped me, Light or Darkness made no matter. Once I accepted that, the Darkness ceased to be frightening. It was another matter of perspective. \n\nCZ: Hmm. Thank you, Elsie. You've given me a lot to think about. For some reason, your explanation makes me more… comfortable… with the idea. \n\nEB: Any time, Commander. It's all a matter of perspective. \n\nTRANSCRIPTION ENDS","icon":null}},"2648530288":{"hash":2648530288,"index":2568,"redacted":true,"name":null,"iconImagePath":null,"colorImagePath":null,"displayProperties":{"name":"Classified","description":"Keep it secret.
