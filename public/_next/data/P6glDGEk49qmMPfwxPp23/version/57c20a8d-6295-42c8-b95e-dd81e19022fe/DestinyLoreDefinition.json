The function presented more so as an anti-material rifle. \"Looks to be 12.7mm… it's like they were making a hand cannon but didn't know it yet.\"\n\nBanshee wondered further about the warrior who could wield such a thing. His attention drifted momentarily, drawn by Shaxx's voice booming nearby. \"Huh. Yeah. A Titan, maybe… and a big one too.\" \n\nThe weapon was laced with fractures from a life of fire and a sleep of ice, and perhaps other, more exotic stresses. Banshee wished he could've heard the relic's voice, but he knew from earlier examination that it had fired its last round. What a last round it must have been.\n\nThe Guardian who brought it to him might be willing to try a shot, untroubled by the risk of a rapid unplanned dismantle. But Banshee knew it wouldn't last through a single magazine. \n\nBeside the relic lay a stripped-down Breachlight. He would adapt it for a larger round. Custom casings and handguard. Sensorium link scope… and he had other ideas to try as well. \n\nIt would be an homage, an offering to the creators of the original relic. A legacy.\n\nWith that satisfying thought in mind, the gunsmith went to work.","icon":null}}},"previousDefinitions":{},"otherDefinitions":{},"tableDiff":{"added":[],"unclassified":[],"removed":[],"reclassified":[],"modified":[2179048386]},"tableDiffSummary":{"added":0,"unclassified":0,"removed":0,"reclassified":0,"modified":1},"tableName":"DestinyLoreDefinition","missingTable":false,"versionDiffSummary":{"DestinyActivityDefinition":{"added":0,"unclassified":0,"removed":0,"reclassified":0,"modified":1},"DestinyUnlockDefinition":{"added":1,"unclassified":0,"removed":0,"reclassified":0,"modified":0},"DestinySandboxPerkDefinition":{"added":1,"unclassified":0,"removed":0,"reclassified":0,"modified":0},"DestinyCollectibleDefinition":{"added":0,"unclassified":0,"removed":0,"reclassified":0,"modified":1},"DestinyInventoryItemDefinition":{"added":0,"unclassified":0,"removed":0,"reclassified":0,"modified":3},"DestinyLoreDefinition":{"added":0,"unclassified":0,"removed":0,"reclassified":0,"modified":1},"DestinyVendorDefinition":{"added":0,"unclassified":0,"removed":0,"reclassified":0,"modified":3}},"meta":{"buildDate":"2024-12-14T02:33:51.296Z"}},"__N_SSG":true}
