He does not ask but simply takes a breath and follows Lord Saladin.\n \n***\n \nIt is decades until a message arrives from Amani—half crumpled and discolored from the uncertain journey it took to reach him in the Last City. \"Come quickly,\" it reads. \"Before it is too late.\"\n \nBut he arrives too late. \n \nAmani stands at the grave among the mourners, stooped, old. He nods to her, catching her eyes for a moment. A sad, familiar smile crosses her lips again before she returns the gesture in silent thanks.\n \nHe waits until most have left before he approaches the headstone. He holds a flower, picked on his journey. It was fresh when he found it, but its petals are bruised now as he gently places it on the churned earth of her grave.\n \nZavala rises and sees a woman standing beside him. They have the same eyes, warm and kind. Her daughter.\n \n\"How did you know her?\" she asks. His breath catches, unsure of how to answer a simple question from one mourner to another.\n \n\"I'm an old friend,\" he says, unable to keep the weariness from seeping into his words. The woman looks at him askance; he wonders, briefly, if she knows of him, his history. Her brother. But she simply nods and thanks him, and nothing more is said.\n \nYears later, he visits the woman's grave. Then her son's. Her son's son. The graveyard grows thick with headstones. He makes the journey each time.\n \nThey do not come to the Last City for 10 generations. The Hidden tell him when they are born, when they are sick, and when they die. He never speaks to them when they are alive, but at each grave, he leaves a token and a question: Can you forgive me?\n \nThe Red War does not claim them, but when the City grieves for those lost to the Vex and the Endless Night, Zavala grieves for the last of Safiyah's descendants. This time, there is no body for a grave.\n \nNow, Zavala sits at his desk. The knitting needles are worn with use. He holds them carefully, remembering how she had placed his fingers so that he could follow her movements. \n\nHe casts on a length of yarn and begins again.","icon":"/common/destiny2_content/icons/775cdcdfa2430430ae34b40eace883a7.png"}},"1866406133":{"hash":1866406133,"index":2028,"redacted":false,"name":null,"iconImagePath":null,"colorImagePath":null,"displayProperties":{"name":"RRHEXIS","description":"Zavala lays Hakim down on his bed, supporting him so that his head comes to rest softly on the pillow.

She swings open the door. Her husband flinches, turns, sees her standing at the threshold. Careful, she walks to him, puts a hand on his arm, lowers his gun. Zavala falls to his knees, the gun clattering to the floor.\n \nSafiyah reaches for Targe, and he floats to her. She holds him in her hands. There is a thrum, a warmth, in her palms.

You are honored above all, and when our new Cabal stands before eternity, you will be among the first.\n\nI have heard the rumors whispered between you, my subjects. Rumors fed to you by our enemies. Your hope that I have not been vanquished is well placed, for I am so very much alive. You fear that we are defeated, but nothing could be further from the truth.\n\nYou wonder if I am a spirit, if I have become something beyond Cabal, if I have ascended like Acrius did when he cradled the sun in his grasp. Allow me to soothe your curiosity: yes, I have become all you have imagined, and so much more.\n\nThe Guardians believe they hold victory, but soon, they will see the truth they have ignored with such determination: this road is long, but it only has one end. They served to set my plans solidly in the foundations of the universe. Their petty attacks, while tragic in their costs to my dear crew, cannot halt our purpose.\n\nSo, my soldiers… I leave you this task: hold the Leviathan. Show no quarter to those who would walk the halls of your home as invaders. It is your final task before you may be uplifted to sit beside me at the end.\n\nI do not promise that every Cabal standing on the Leviathan will survive this journey, but under my loving watch, you will live and die in nothing less than greatness. What more can a warrior desire but an exciting life and a good death? Have I not given you both?\n\n\n-From the mouth of Amsot, High Scribe to the unbound emperor, Calus, who none can contain:\nRejoice! Praise Calus, who ascends. For he keeps you in his mind, and there you will never die.","icon":"/common/destiny2_content/icons/f2005fcf3a76b857333f3f6a56fd7392.png"}},"2419786603":{"hash":2419786603,"index":2022,"redacted":false,"name":null,"iconImagePath":null,"colorImagePath":null,"displayProperties":{"name":"VII.
