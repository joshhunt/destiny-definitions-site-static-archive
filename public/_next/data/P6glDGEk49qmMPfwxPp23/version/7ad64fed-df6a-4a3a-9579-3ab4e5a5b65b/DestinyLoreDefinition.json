MSUND12/Personal","description":"PERSONAL LOG\n\n003 AS\n\nI am still among the Vex. My third day of reawakening has been the cruelest so far. I have generated a log to sort through my thoughts. This is just too much to take all at once. My ability to focus is strained with a shrill and immediate grief. My heart lived in my beloved's hands—how am I supposed to comprehend that this isn't just absence, but death? There will be evidence, histories these meticulous machines would have catalogued. I will find evidence that I was missed… am missed. I know what I must do. The primary query continues.\n\n008 AS\n\nAfter two days of requesting authorization, the Vex finally granted me access to their historical records of Earth. I read a term for an era I never knew; the Collapse. And indeed… they did. Technological capabilities impacted, hostile combatants occupying the majority of the planet for far too long, invention and experimentation (NOT related to paracausal power sources) halted for centuries. It seems humanity was huddled together like wet kittens, the cramped and stifled survivors of monumental destruction. I read the records as if they were about some other civilization's primitive past rather than my own. The Vex documented it all, collected all they could smother their milk with: one Human wrote about the day they stood on the edge of an abandoned dam and watched a swarm of small machines spew from some unseen seam in the Traveler, how Nezarec's ships turned day into midnight. How the years that followed hastened humanity's extinction—countries that turned to anarchy then to feudalism, the art and technology we bled and wept to champion abandoned as power grids failed and disasters swelled. Humanity could have kept experimenting and learning, but when Earth died, so, too, what made them Human. They forgot everything we were. \n\n0028  AS\n\nPast events mean little to a threat so preoccupied with iterating on the future. While Vex do not share my interest in history, they have tracked this timeline all the same. There are trillions of alternate versions, of course, and it seems these Vex diligently dispose of those potentialities once a present moment slides chronologically into the past. I've thrown myself into these records—the primary query is in full force.\n\nIt seems Humans have retained none of their virtues or diligence, only resilience through violence. Their numbers have radically reduced, only enough to fill a single city. They suffer a supplication of scientific rigor; what inventions have they made? What disease have they cured? Who is BETTER here? Most disappointingly, Humans seem to have forgotten the entirety of their history, and instead of something sensible, went and established a junta.\n\nEarth is a near-total loss. Advanced cities have been replaced over centuries by encroaching overgrowth of native species and the ruin of time. The climate's balance was erased by Warlords. Universal democracy has collapsed into military rule (again, for emphasis, instead of trying to recreate the forms of governance they KNEW existed, they concluded that voting is for elitist braggarts and empowered a JUNTA). The more I see the mistakes humanity made, the more obvious the solutions are… It is clear that during the Collapse, they had nothing but terror, empty of anything other than sheer survival, but how insulting it feels to look at what became of the future and only see frightened and frothing dogs. There are lessons to be learned in their methods, but the result is inelegant and crude.\n\nIf these people are to see the future, they must look backwards to what they lost. I now have the means to aid them. \n\n0032 AS\n\nI have tamed the untamable. With practice, and soon with mastery, with a single phrase, I can divert the Vex's sea of iteration and death. Think of the utility! We could retake home, dissolve the walls of the Last City, and let each person decide what home means to them! With targeted hostility, we may clear a path for peace, revive the machines of science and learning once again. Someday, with technology redistributed from Vex to humanity, every need can be met with any simulation. All it will take is an alignment of interests through measured coercion! It's so simple. \n\nAnd yet, all that must wait. Primary query MUST be concluded—it is the one outstanding variable. There have been too many false positives—none of them are correct. NONE. The query is only turning back facsimiles, trick mirrors. I know I'm right, and I will not stop until the primary query stops pulling from false datasets. I can think of little else. We must look backward. I must look backward. I must. I must.","icon":"/common/destiny2_content/icons/2cfd18dcf908263d3b1c129e383ea8ce.png"}}},"previousDefinitions":{},"otherDefinitions":{},"tableDiff":{"added":[],"unclassified":[1883196289],"removed":[],"reclassified":[],"modified":[]},"tableDiffSummary":{"added":0,"unclassified":1,"removed":0,"reclassified":0,"modified":0},"tableName":"DestinyLoreDefinition","missingTable":false,"versionDiffSummary":{"DestinyActivityDefinition":{"added":0,"unclassified":1,"removed":0,"reclassified":0,"modified":4},"DestinyUnlockDefinition":{"added":17,"unclassified":0,"removed":0,"reclassified":0,"modified":0},"DestinyUnlockValueDefinition":{"added":4,"unclassified":0,"removed":0,"reclassified":0,"modified":0},"DestinyRewardMappingDefinition":{"added":4,"unclassified":0,"removed":0,"reclassified":0,"modified":0},"DestinyFireteamFinderActivityGraphDefinition":{"added":3,"unclassified":0,"removed":0,"reclassified":0,"modified":8},"DestinyFireteamFinderActivitySetDefinition":{"added":3,"unclassified":0,"removed":0,"reclassified":0,"modified":7},"DestinyInventoryItemDefinition":{"added":0,"unclassified":23,"removed":0,"reclassified":0,"modified":4},"DestinyLoreDefinition":{"added":0,"unclassified":1,"removed":0,"reclassified":0,"modified":0},"DestinyObjectiveDefinition":{"added":2,"unclassified":0,"removed":0,"reclassified":0,"modified":7},"DestinySandboxPerkDefinition":{"added":0,"unclassified":5,"removed":0,"reclassified":0,"modified":0},"DestinyRecordDefinition":{"added":0,"unclassified":1,"removed":0,"reclassified":0,"modified":9},"DestinyUnlockEventDefinition":{"added":2,"unclassified":0,"removed":0,"reclassified":0,"modified":0},"DestinyUnlockExpressionMappingDefinition":{"added":1,"unclassified":0,"removed":0,"reclassified":0,"modified":0},"DestinyVendorDefinition":{"added":0,"unclassified":0,"removed":0,"reclassified":0,"modified":2}},"meta":{"buildDate":"2024-12-14T02:35:09.339Z"}},"__N_SSG":true}
