Retro.\" Even through the holoprojector's patchy connection and the rippling visage of Nimbus, there's no missing the excitement in their voice as it echoes off the walls of the Arcology. \"You said this was New Pacific tech?\" \n\n\"Found it not too far from here,\" Sloane replies.  \n\n\"We've still got some of their old records. I always liked their jingle.\" \n\nSloane smiles. \"'The next frontier is you?'\"  \n\n\"That's the one. Catchy, right?\" Nimbus grins. \"So hey, you're absolutely onto something—this exoskeleton of yours looks a whole lot like some of the early Cloud Strider prototypes I learned about. Before the Sidereal. Before the nanotech. Just a couple of neural links and some chrome. This biointerface—\"  \n\nSloane snorts. \"The part where the suit stabbed me full of wires?\" \n\n\"The frame alone must weigh a couple of tons. And you wore it into battle?\"  \n\n\"Sure did.\"  \n\nNimbus's projection looks up at her with a serious expression. \"You are so cool.\" They focus for a moment on the datapad in their hand. \"I know some gearheads who'll flip. Quinn's gonna love this thing.\"  \n\n\"There are a few design flaws,\" Sloane says. \"Once the suit was out of juice, it was impossible to maneuver. I basically had to rip myself out of it.\"  \n\nNimbus laughs. \"Hey, there's downsides to the shiny new model too.\"  \n\nSloane wasn't sure what to expect from this exchange when Zavala first proposed it to her. A polite back and forth about Golden Age technology, as one might have with the Cryptarchs. Maybe a few resentful accusations, a little culture clash.  \n\nNot this sense of recognition, like an old, familiar ache. \n\nNimbus's smile is radiant. \"Still, while you're along for the ride? What a rush.\"  \n\nSloane nods. \"Best feeling in the world.\"","icon":null}},"3256453690":{"hash":3256453690,"index":2408,"redacted":false,"name":null,"iconImagePath":null,"colorImagePath":null,"displayProperties":{"name":"Crowning Duologue","description":"It took a full seven minutes before Lord Shaxx stopped pretending that the screen in front of him was transmitting a live Crucible match and not a looped recording. He finally let out an aggrieved sigh and folded his arms across his chest.  \n\n\"Forge.\" \n\n\"If you can spare a few moments,\" Lord Saladin said, with grim humor, \"I wanted to talk.\"  \n\nShaxx leveled his helmet in Saladin's direction.  \n\nSaladin returned his stare. \"Fine. It isn't a matter of wanting. We need to talk.\" Saladin braced himself. \"About Twilight Gap.\"  \n\nShaxx turned to face Saladin, arms sliding down to his sides. His chest expanded as he filled the great bellows of his lungs.  \n\n\"You made the right call,\" Saladin said, quickly.  \n\nThere was a muffled, choked sound from beneath Shaxx's helmet.  \n\n\"We've always known that much.\" Saladin's mouth twisted unhappily. He turned his gaze to the City's horizon, feigning interest in a flooded crater near the outskirts. \"Even if I refused to admit it.\" \n\n\"You saw hope where I couldn't. I told myself your defiance was grandstanding.\" Saladin laughed ruefully. \"I'd given up. But you—you and your fireteam bought us time. Enough time for all of us to change.\" \n\nShaxx stood unmoving. They both waited in protracted silence.  \n\nAt last, Saladin sighed. \"After all these years, after everything… I trust your judgment. I just wanted you to know that.\"  \n\nShaxx's helmet shifted, just slightly. \"Before the end?\"  \n\n\"Before whatever comes next.\"  \n\nShaxx nodded slowly.  \n\n\"You know, I had a host of incredibly scathing comments prepared for this moment.\"  \n\nSaladin smiled. \"I bet you did.\"","icon":null}}},"previousDefinitions":{},"otherDefinitions":{},"tableDiff":{"added":[3110986887,3256453690],"unclassified":[940371471],"removed":[],"reclassified":[],"modified":[]},"tableDiffSummary":{"added":2,"unclassified":1,"removed":0,"reclassified":0,"modified":0},"tableName":"DestinyLoreDefinition","missingTable":false,"versionDiffSummary":{"DestinyActivityDefinition":{"added":1,"unclassified":0,"removed":0,"reclassified":0,"modified":1},"DestinyUnlockDefinition":{"added":142,"unclassified":21,"removed":96,"reclassified":0,"modified":0},"DestinySandboxPerkDefinition":{"added":19,"unclassified":8,"removed":0,"reclassified":0,"modified":0},"DestinyUnlockValueDefinition":{"added":110,"unclassified":13,"removed":103,"reclassified":0,"modified":0},"DestinyRewardMappingDefinition":{"added":99,"unclassified":0,"removed":185,"reclassified":0,"modified":0},"DestinyRewardSheetDefinition":{"added":9,"unclassified":0,"removed":0,"reclassified":0,"modified":0},"DestinyActivityGraphDefinition":{"added":0,"unclassified":0,"removed":0,"reclassified":0,"modified":1},"DestinyActivityInteractableDefinition":{"added":1,"unclassified":0,"removed":0,"reclassified":0,"modified":0},"DestinyCollectibleDefinition":{"added":0,"unclassified":29,"removed":0,"reclassified":0,"modified":1},"DestinyEventCardDefinition":{"added":0,"unclassified":0,"removed":0,"reclassified":0,"modified":1},"DestinyInventoryItemDefinition":{"added":134,"unclassified":79,"removed":2,"reclassified":0,"modified":2399},"DestinyLoreDefinition":{"added":2,"unclassified":1,"removed":0,"reclassified":0,"modified":0},"DestinyMaterialRequirementSetDefinition":{"added":6,"unclassified":0,"removed":0,"reclassified":0,"modified":0},"DestinyObjectiveDefinition":{"added":97,"unclassified":10,"removed":106,"reclassified":0,"modified":8},"DestinyPlugSetDefinition":{"added":9,"unclassified":6,"removed":9,"reclassified":0,"modified":1103},"DestinyPresentationNodeDefinition":{"added":1,"unclassified":0,"removed":3,"reclassified":0,"modified":2},"DestinyProgressionDefinition":{"added":0,"unclassified":0,"removed":0,"reclassified":0,"modified":1},"DestinyRecordDefinition":{"added":19,"unclassified":4,"removed":96,"reclassified":0,"modified":4},"DestinyRewardItemListDefinition":{"added":28,"unclassified":0,"removed":0,"reclassified":0,"modified":0},"DestinySandboxPatternDefinition":{"added":0,"unclassified":1,"removed":0,"reclassified":0,"modified":0},"DestinySocketTypeDefinition":{"added":17,"unclassified":2,"removed":0,"reclassified":0,"modified":0},"DestinyUnlockEventDefinition":{"added":1,"unclassified":0,"removed":0,"reclassified":0,"modified":0},"DestinyUnlockExpressionMappingDefinition":{"added":33,"unclassified":0,"removed":10,"reclassified":0,"modified":0},"DestinyVendorDefinition":{"added":0,"unclassified":5,"removed":0,"reclassified":0,"modified":5},"DestinyMilestoneDefinition":{"added":1,"unclassified":0,"removed":0,"reclassified":0,"modified":0},"DestinyActivityModifierDefinition":{"added":4,"unclassified":0,"removed":0,"reclassified":0,"modified":0}},"meta":{"buildDate":"2024-12-14T02:34:38.279Z"}},"__N_SSG":true}
