The Wildcard","description":"I am Atraks, the Wildcard, and I have been charged by my Kell to speak to the youth of the Eliksni. Those who, like me, have never known a life that wasn't wandering. Who have no memories of Riis, only tales of glorious cities under glowing green skies passed down from our elders. The very same ones who moan that we have never felt true peace, which can only be found under the shade of the Great Machine.\n\nWell, I, for one, am glad for it! I could not be more grateful the Whirlwind came to slice the ties before I was entangled too! They told us it was destruction that visited that day, but what if it was salvation? They called us unlucky to have been born in the dark of deep space, but we were born free! They say we lack the Light to truly see, but when we first opened our eyes, there was nothing to block our view of the vastness of the universe.\n\nSo why do we let the nostalgia-blind point the way? Why do we carry their dead dreams? They have turned their backs on the future! I say, let them! All the easier to strike them down and finish the metamorphosis started long ago.\n\nThen, you can join us on Riis-reborn.","icon":"/common/destiny2_content/icons/31f845bd604a923c3d27845c70ae8f6d.png"}}},"previousDefinitions":{},"otherDefinitions":{},"tableDiff":{"added":[],"unclassified":[],"removed":[],"reclassified":[],"modified":[3072887026]},"tableDiffSummary":{"added":0,"unclassified":0,"removed":0,"reclassified":0,"modified":1},"tableName":"DestinyLoreDefinition","missingTable":false,"versionDiffSummary":{"DestinyActivityDefinition":{"added":0,"unclassified":0,"removed":0,"reclassified":0,"modified":2},"DestinyCollectibleDefinition":{"added":0,"unclassified":0,"removed":0,"reclassified":0,"modified":8},"DestinyInventoryItemDefinition":{"added":0,"unclassified":0,"removed":0,"reclassified":0,"modified":12},"DestinyLoreDefinition":{"added":0,"unclassified":0,"removed":0,"reclassified":0,"modified":1},"DestinyObjectiveDefinition":{"added":0,"unclassified":0,"removed":0,"reclassified":0,"modified":13},"DestinyRecordDefinition":{"added":0,"unclassified":0,"removed":0,"reclassified":0,"modified":2},"DestinyVendorDefinition":{"added":0,"unclassified":0,"removed":0,"reclassified":0,"modified":1}},"meta":{"buildDate":"2024-12-14T02:33:34.974Z"}},"__N_SSG":true}
