The energy in the Tower is so off lately.\" \n\nBehind her, Taranov shakes off her robe to release a shower of spinmetal fragments, gained on an unintended roll through the Mothyards. \"Yeah, but there aren't any working showers here. Let's get going.\" \n\n\"Already?\" Thoughtfully, Nonpareil summons a ball of Void Light and tosses it up and down. \"Hey. Taranov, think fast!\" \n\nThe other Guardian turns around just in time to catch the Light with her face. \n\nTaranov splutters as she's resurrected. \"I will kill you.\" \n\nNonpareil beckons to her. \"Yeah?

After a moment, the noise of the explosion reaches their ears. \n\nThey keep their Ghosts busy with resurrections the whole afternoon. \n\nAs daylight fades, so does their energy. Taranov releases her Dawnblade with a groan. \"You ready to take on the Tower now?\" \n\nNonpareil slings an arm over her shoulder. \"We're going to fix the Tower. Good times for everyone! Listen: we get in on the ground floor of a whole new sports league. Bookings. Betting. Licensed gear. The works.\" \n\nSunset over Old Russia is a beautiful sight. Small fires burn in the scrub. The view warms Nonpareil's heart. \n\nA week later, they have 300 signups for their new grenadeketball league, and roughly as many citations from the Praxics for alleged manipulation of betting rings.","icon":null}},"1878244597":{"hash":1878244597,"index":2606,"redacted":false,"name":null,"iconImagePath":null,"colorImagePath":null,"displayProperties":{"name":"Allstar Vector","description":"\"You're telling me these…'Skimmers' just turned up?\"  \n\nPrak'kesh prods gingerly at one of the boards with his foot.

A judicious boost between the supports of the Six Fronts memorial. And straight through the middle of the pack. \n\nDistrict 125's streets are dark at night, the streetlights few and far between. The occasional neon sign is diffused by the running lights and exhaust trails of a dozen Sparrows jockeying for space. \n\nFarrukh hunkers down over his restored EV-34 Vector Infinite, his pride and joy. His whole fireteam put down the last of their Glimmer and materials to upgrade her and get a seat at this race. Without sanctioned SRL events, it's drag racing betting rings where Guardians can make their profits. \n\nAnd they need it bad.  \n\nFarrukh's gloves creak on his handlebars. He takes a risk going tight around a corner and cuts off a Warlock on a Sharklight, aiming for the front-runners. \n\nThe big names are here tonight: Boaz, Gris, Cron-8, even the up-and-coming Niik. Their skills might secure this win. But they don't want it the way Farrukh does. \n\nIt gets worse every week, their debt piling up. The Spider's smirk audible even through his filters, offering worse deals, dirtier jobs. They need a clean break. Clean Vanguard work. Just one race and they can buy their way out. \n\nSerapion gutted his Sparrow's braking system for Farrukh's EV. Tammuz-4 pawned their first bond. It's Farrukh on the track tonight, but his team's with him. \n\nStreetlights flash by faster as the pack leaves the warehouses behind, drifting hard around an overpass. Farrukh's near the middle, waiting on his last boost.  \n\nStreet racing's all about calculated risks. And this is their biggest. \n\nHe waits for the moment–waits as the Sharklight passes him again, and the racers around him slam their boosts–and hits his own for the final push. Half a block to make up. Half a block between him and his team's future. \n\nHe weaves through the pack, pushing his boost hard just as all the others wear out, and slams into the finish with another Sparrow an inch behind his nose. \n\nThe roar of the crowd is a physical force, slamming into Farrukh like a Sentinel's shield. \n\nThe racer in second yanks off their helmet and points straight at Farrukh. \"How did you pull that out of your antique?\" \n\nFarrukh looks out through the crowd for Tammuz and Sera, shouldering their way over to him, looking as shellshocked as he feels. They made it. They're safe. \n\nHe smiles, heart going 160. \n\n\"It's not what you're racing,\" Farrukh says. \"It's who you're racing for.\"","icon":null}},"3720087872":{"hash":3720087872,"index":2603,"redacted":false,"name":null,"iconImagePath":null,"colorImagePath":null,"displayProperties":{"name":"Allstar Mark","description":"The afternoon sun warms the courtyard's flagstones.
