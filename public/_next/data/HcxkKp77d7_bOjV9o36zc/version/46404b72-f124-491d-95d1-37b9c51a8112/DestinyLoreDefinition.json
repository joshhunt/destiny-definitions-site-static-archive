Gotta be hungry, starving for best effect. I start getting those pangs, and that's when I hear it, almost like a voice whispering through me. When I first learned that lesson, I thought morning jobs would be a dealbreaker, with breakfast being the most important meal of the day and all. Yet here I am, at the crack of dawn, perched on top of a big ol' tree, fantasizing about my next bite. Not terrible as far as stakeouts go, and if you gotta pay off a debt to a scummy scum-lord, then you're lucky to have a place to sit.\n\nI've got eyes on my mark; have for days. This Kell's finally looking nice and cozy, asleep in the open and surrounded by his servants. Thought they're supposed to be the last line of defense, but they haven't noticed me yet. Guess good help is hard to come by.\n\nI'd have taken the shot hours ago, but I'm supposed to shoot a warning first, so he knows what's coming. That way he \"goes out knowing who got him.\" Warlords love sending their little messages, and it's gonna fall on deaf ears if he's asleep. This guy just keeps snoozing. I envy that.\n\nWhich reminds me, I've discovered another little trick to getting in good with that yawning mouth of nothing we call the Void: exhaustion. When I start slipping into that twilight, where I'm not sure if I'm awake or dreaming, I can feel the absence. It's close enough to touch. I guess it doesn't matter if it's literal or metaphorical. The Void just likes it when I'm running on empty.\n\nHe's stirring now. Time to get this done. I loose a volley into his bed post. The telltale otherworldly sucking sound—poor guy tries to fight it, but he's got no chance. He looks around frantically for the shooter, then recognition hits his face. That's my cue! …Boom, job done. Can't do that on a full stomach.","icon":null}},"162269058":{"hash":162269058,"index":2051,"redacted":true,"name":null,"iconImagePath":null,"colorImagePath":null,"displayProperties":{"name":"Classified","description":"Keep it secret.

The rest before the note, the breath before the word, the blank space on the page.\"  \n\nA chill hit the air, and I looked up from my studies. There was a stillness, an uneasy calm before the storm. An ambush awaited me; of that, I was certain. No time to wonder how my defenses had failed. No time to ponder how they had found my hidden library in the first place. I had only just lifted my eyes from those insightful words on the Void. Now, I'd have to take my first steps upon it and hope I didn't fall right through. \n\n\"Seize her,\" the lead marauder thundered. Through every window crashed enemies intent on my destruction. Time stretched out before me. With a thought, I was at the center of the fray. A gaping, celestial maw drained the life from them. I found my footing: the power of the Void was manifest, yet this was not its full nature. \n\nThe next instant, reality snapped back into its traditional rhythm. I was alone once more. The intruders didn't even have time to comprehend their fate. I was barely more enlightened than they were, yet I had gleaned one fundamental truth. \n\nA step upon the Void is a step upon that nothing which can bear the weight.","icon":null}},"737550160":{"hash":737550160,"index":2057,"redacted":true,"name":null,"iconImagePath":null,"colorImagePath":null,"displayProperties":{"name":"Classified","description":"Keep it secret.

No, no automat for supper; no noodles. Tonight is something special: corn pone and chitlins. This here's history on a plate. Now, don't give me that look before you even taste it. If the world's fixing to end again, it's time you had a meal from our family's past while you hear about it. About how the Rigby clan survived the last time the world went dark.\n\nNow the Rigbys, we didn't always squat on the edge of the City. A long time back, we came out of a place that was old and wet, hotter than the fires of Perdition—so your Gramma's gramma and her pappy before her have said. It was also a place where the Devil roamed, giving folk their heart's desire.\n\nAnd I know that last part is true, because your ancestor—Sean Rigby was his name—he came to a crossroads one midnight, drunk and feeling the fool, and…  he saw her. Standing there, checking the time and looking cool as no other in the sweltering August heat. Tall as cottonwood in bloom and wearing a smile across her lips that stopped short of her eyes. Some say the Devil is a man with a pointy beard. Others say the Devil's a terrifying beast with claws and a tail. But Sean? He knew right then. The Devil was a lady.\n\nThe Devil bent down close to him, setting her eyes on his wayward soul. Her voice was honeysuckle-sweet as she said, \"I know you, Sean Rigby. I seen you sweat and sob for a scrap of land you can't even rightly say is your own. I seen your family fight to save a name that's more precious to you than gold. Well there is a reckoning coming, Sean Rigby, one that will wipe all lands and all names—high and low—clean from this Earth. I alone can whistle up the way to protect one of these things you hold dear, if your family will owe me… a debt.\"\n\nOld Sean was already a sinner, but a man with nothing will fight to keep what little he has. He figured that alive and in the Devil's pocket was better than dead, so he shook her hand. The Devil opened her eyes—one, two, three—and pointed him to the last star in the sky, far to the south. She said, \"That's your star, Sean Rigby. Follow it each night, when it's the last star hanging low, and sing to it. You sing, 'Al Eck Ruk Nam, Shu Nam Eck Ur,' until you call that star down to Earth. You do that, and your family will endure.\" \n\nThe Rigbys did as they were told and walked south. Each night they sang, and each night their star sat lower and lower. And when it finally fell, they were safe beneath the Traveler.\n\nBut now, children, I give you the same dire warning that's been handed down to me: the Devil hasn't come back yet to take what's hers… not from Sean, or any other Rigby what survived him. But a debt's a debt. So you learn and remember that song, children… and steer clear of crossroads once the sun sets.","icon":null}},"1443166262":{"hash":1443166262,"index":2084,"redacted":true,"name":null,"iconImagePath":null,"colorImagePath":null,"displayProperties":{"name":"Classified","description":"Keep it secret.

Siegfried ached. He couldn't remember the last time he had been sore after a fight.\n\n\"Good morning, sir.\" Siegfried's Ghost, Ogden, hovered over the samples the Titan had taken. \"The sorcery these dullards are using is extremely unstable.\"\n\n\"I asked you to stay away from that. It's desecrated.\" Siegfried swiped the samples into his satchel from the gear rack in his tent. \"In truth, I'd prefer you remained stowed until we departed.\"\n\n\"You were not so rude as a boy, you know.\" The Ghost squinted at his Titan. \"When I express concern, Master Siegfried tells me not to fret. Could I not say the same?\"\n\n\"Different times, old friend. Now my body's a fair bit cheaper to replace than yours,\" Siegfried joked.\n\n\"Fine point, sir.\"\n\nThe journey to the Techeuns was silent and uncomfortable. He met Petra in the cabin nose-deep in papers. Hoarse screams buried in the hard-blown fog. The Reef was shifting. She had requested his presence but informed him he would not be allowed inside the Temple. Ridiculous. Why was he here? Siegfried's thoughts were abuzz with distortion. Chaos. He followed Petra's march to the Temple chambers, the satchel of samples gripped tightly in his hand. She must have her reasons.  Her secrets. The stairways seemed endless and Siegfried could not shake the image from the cavern. That macabre ritual. He tried to think of anything else.\n\n\"Are there any other Guardians operating in this area?\" Siegfried questioned.\n\n\"Guardians come and go, but I haven't noticed anything unusual, if that's what you mean.\"\n\n\"Nothing you aren't telling me?\"\n\n\"I have no reason to lie to you, Titan.\"\n\n\"I saw a man.\"\n\nPetra stopped walking. The Temple door was only a few steps away. \"Is there more?\"\n\n\"He was Awoken. He bore the Spider's sigil—\"\n\n\"Where did you see this man?\"\n\n\"During your operation.\" Siegfried paused. \"He gunned down an ogre in my defense and fled.\"\n\n\"Noble for a Syndicate fly.\"\n\n\"I know you fraternize with the Spider.\" Siegfried watched her.\n\nPetra looked taken aback for a moment, then composed. \"Do you know why spiders build webs, Titan?\"\n\n\"I don't concern myself with such things.\"\n\n\"They enjoy control. Entrapment. The helplessness. Pulling strings in their small, little corners. Let them be, watched but undisturbed, and they catch other pests. Worse pests.\" Petra strode forward and placed a hand on the door. \"Maybe it's time to check his web.\" The other held out for the satchel. \"I'll look into it.\"\n\nSiegfried placed it in her hand. \"I eagerly await your findings.\"\n\n\"The Techeuns may need your account.\" Petra smirked to herself, \"I give you dominion over these stairs. Stand guard, Sir Titan. Patrol if you'd like.\"\n\nKalli, Sedia, and Shuro Chi awaited the Queen's Wrath. They placed the specimens each in a sealed containment vessel. They assessed them one by one. They prepared their minds. Slipped into meditation.\n\nTooth, blood, and bone from the sacrificial Knight. Coagulated Soulfire. Shaved tissue of the writhe.\n\nCommunion in searching.Three voices speak as one.Noise upon noise.Eleusinia drowning.\n\nA terrace of emerald flame above a red harborFingers reach like blades from distant hollowsTestingProddingTastingBreeding war.\n\nA dream is offered.\n\nRED SKY: They carry a brand in the consciousness of their tissues.\n\nMORNING: Individual existences all touched in chorus.\n\nFULL OF DREAD: Xivu Arath. Avatar of War.\n\nMore. So much more.\n\nThey witnessed it all.\n\nPetra wished she had not.\n\nSiegfried sat lost in thought, seated on the steps. He didn't like the idea of relying on witchcraft, especially that which he was unable to observe. If nothing else, it could at least be faster.\n\nThe door opened behind him. Petra's face showed signs of fatigue. \"I'm sorry to keep you waiting. Return to the staging ground. I'll join you in the morning. There is still much to discuss here.\" She considered Siegfried for a moment. \"Tell the Vanguard Ikora's dream had merit. I'll be in contact.\"\n\nSiegfried sighed and stood. \"I see my account of the situation was not necessary.\"\n\nHe felt lighter now, moving down the stairs. Sharp even, as he entered the skimmer. Siegfried wasn't sure if it was the peace of an empty cabin or the security of a troop carrier escorting him. The satchel he had left with Petra. None of his concern. He removed his helmet and took a deep breath. He let his mind drift as he watched the beauty of the Strand pass. The grand gateway above him. The fabled crystalline wall standing against the fog. The wall. Atop the wall. Perched like a buzzard.\n\nIt was him.\n\nSomething hovered with him, glinting in the light.\n\n\"There he is again!\" barked Siegfried. He flung the door open and leapt without waiting for the skimmer to slow. The Titan soared through the air on Light, surging forward in an electrified dash before sliding into a full sprint. He crested the hill above the crystalline wall soon enough. Motion dragged into the shoreline mist. Siegfried pursued it.","icon":null}},"1780464822":{"hash":1780464822,"index":2003,"redacted":true,"name":null,"iconImagePath":null,"colorImagePath":null,"displayProperties":{"name":"Classified","description":"Keep it secret.

I have unwound a precious few mysteries that I believe can aid us. The Crown's penchant for ensnaring cognition is well-known, but the function by which it does this is a manipulation of the Darkness tethered by Hive incantations and ritual. It is not unlike how the Pyramid projects Nightmares from troubled persons, or phantoms  from places of great loss.\n\nI am not so foolish as to attempt to access or wield the Crown directly. We have all seen where that leads. Instead, with assistance from a trusted colleague, I have constructed a medium through which we may safely channel the Crown's influence and bind Nightmares until their essence can be contained for further research. My colleague dubbed this medium a \"Harvester.\" An apt denotation. \n\nUntil we know more about Calus's plans, this is our best course of action. I advise all fireteams undergoing deployment to the Leviathan be outfitted with [REQUISITION;DEVICE-HARVESTER]. Once they are attuned to it, possession of a Harvester will offer a moderate level of warding, and more importantly, interaction  with the apparitions projected by the Pyramid. Interestingly, in moments of high energy concentration, the Harvester, as if by reflex, will manifest a weapon through the wielder's will.\n\nI have included a list of materials required for the fabrication of a Harvester.
