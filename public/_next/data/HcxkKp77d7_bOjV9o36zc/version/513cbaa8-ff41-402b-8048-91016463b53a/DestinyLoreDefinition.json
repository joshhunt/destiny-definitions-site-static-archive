Cables groan, steps squeak, hammocks rustle. Ether-bright eyes should glow and blink in the comfortable dark. \n\nYaraskis had expected they would fill up the station, all of them, with repaired machinery and stolen comforts and familiar sounds. \n\nAll the station's sounds are lonely now. Even the station-voice would be a comfort, almost. \n\nShe hasn't seen Karrho in days. The remaining engineers only talk to each other, and the Servitors groan and bob in the air together in one nervous bundle. \n\nAnd something is stalking the hallways. \n\nIt has eyes like an Eliksni, but they don't flicker like they should. They burn steadily, lit not by Ether but by something else. Even the Marauders tell her about it in whispers, so scared they ignore hierarchy. \n\nYaraskis feels its presence in her spiracles. She decides to head for Karrho's workshop. She can hide there. \n\nThen a Marauder swings into view. His eyes are strange and he doesn't look at Yaraskis. He just says, \"Come here.\" \n\nShe runs. Through the halls, leaping over platforms strung together, scoring her side badly on an unexpected twist of metal. \n\nThe missing crew loom out of corners, calling out as she runs past. She doesn't stop. \n\nTill a voice calls her by name. \n\nIt's Karrho. He's braced himself in a corner of the ceiling near a broken vent grate that Yaraskis knows leads to the station hull. It's too small for anyone bigger than a Drekh. \n\nShe leaps. Hands claw at her ankles as Yaraskis kicks her way up the wall. \n\n\"This way,\" Karrho urges. They scurry through twisting passages, through the vents and under floors that long-ago Humans never meant for anyone to walk in. They run over wreckage, in and out of the gravity generators' pull, towards the Ketch. Maybe they'll be safe there. Maybe they can cast off and run. \n\n\"What's wrong with them?\" Yaraskis asks, panting. Her heart kicks hard in her chest. \n\n\"Nothing.\" \n\nKarrho stops on a dime at the vent's exit. Yaraskis's momentum takes her clear past him, into a wide room. \n\nShe looks far up into the bright steady glare of mechanical eyes. Filled with an alien light. \n\nAnd Karrho pushes her forward into the waiting arms of the White Captain.","icon":null}},"4190676582":{"hash":4190676582,"index":2858,"redacted":false,"name":null,"iconImagePath":null,"colorImagePath":null,"displayProperties":{"name":"Spacewalk Robes","description":"Twenty-three days since arrival. \n\nThe Ether generator is taking shape, a big ringed shell set a safe distance from the hull, cradled in wiring. Their crew's three spinners are busy all the time making more cabling. \n\nExcept somehow it's too quiet. The older crew are a little snooty about Drekhs, and that's fine—but Yaraskis can't even find one of them to be snooty at her. \n\nPaskir is still missing. She and Karrho hunted for him up and down the station for hours. \n\nNobody suggests going back down to the surface. They'd be killed outright. Their big plan—a hidden warren where nobody will ever bother them again—has to work. \n\nYaraskis sticks to the smaller, dimly lit corridors now, where only the Drekhs fit. She doesn't like the big, open ones with their flat, bright lights, reverberating acoustics, and the feeling that something is always watching her. \n\nKarrho stays at his work. Yaraskis, ignoring her own, explores the station instead, hunting for their missing crewmates. She makes a tally as she goes, checking every corner of the station, and keeping an ear out for the barely audible whine of a charged scattercape. \n\nA full third of the crew are… gone. \n\nShe hears a muted shriek, something under the flickering buzz of a dying light. Then the scrape of metal on metal. She hunches her shoulders deeper into her cloak against the feeling of being followed. \n\nThe scraping sound stalks her even through her shortcuts. She turns to look back. Still nothing. \n\nShe can't find Paskir. She can't find anyone. There's nothing to do but give up.  \n\nYaraskis heads back to Karrho's workshop. \n\nIt's empty.
