They do not leave their command sleeve for the weeks-long duration of the journey. They have addressed the fleet many times, sought to bolster morale, to give them hope—what hope existed. Their speeches hang in concert but have no presence in the mind of the fleet. As repairs are completed to ships too damaged to continue, the rest wait to jump. \n\nTired tendrils slip from the command sleeve as it unwraps from Te'Qal's body. Their legs and forelimb tentacle numbly fold against the ground as atmospheric waste expels from hissing tubes that suspend the sleeve. The command chamber is small. Te'Qal lays in a circular perforated indentation in the floor. Most of the surrounding housing maintains the sleeve, and keeps the Warden alive, alert. The remainder of the ship houses drones, support systems, and automated functions.  \n\nExhaustion keeps Te'Qal motionless, centered in the indentation in the floor, the fleet orbiting around them. They need rest. Sustenance. But most of all they need guidance. \n\nIsolated from an ark-ship in which to seek the ceremony of a jaw-beast, Te'Qal depresses a plate in the floor and releases a mist of nectar into the command chamber. The name Te'Qal begins to fade, but as they dream, they hold it in their mind… \n\n… \n\n…They stand across a dark, domed room fifty paces from Te'Daru: the Qugu whose tentacle pulled Te'Qal from the silt. Who taught them to commune with the line of warriors and become a banshee shrieking across space. They recited the legends that tamed foreign stars. \n\n\"What do you intend to do, Te'Qal?\" Te'Dura's voice echoes through the dim room. Between them a large holographic display clarified from the dark blur of unfocused memory. Two fleets oppose each other in the display, one is surrounded. Te'Qal looks to Te'Dura again, now wrapped in a command sleeve. \"Do you concede?\" \n\n\"No.\" Te'Qal remembers this day. They defeated a superior officer and earned command. This was a test they were intended to fail.  \n\n\"No?\" Te'Dura asks, flicking a tendril to motion their ships closer. \"To the last then?\" \n\n\"I remember this. You believed I would concede, and closed in, then I detonated my fleet and took yours with it.\" \n\nSuddenly Te'Dura was beside them. \"Another form of victory.\" \n\n\"I've failed us. I did not understand our ancestor's warning,\" Te'Qal whispers.\n\n\"Then listen closer,\" Te'Dura says. \"This,\" they gesture with a tentacle. \"An unwinnable scenario…\" \n\nThe display shifts to a different theater. \n\n\"This,\" Te'Dura begins. \n\n\"Murin invasion, at the outer rim,\" Te'Qal finishes, now viewing twenty incoming carriers from a command sleeve. \n\n\"Our line of Te, your ships, broke them.\" Te'Dura's voice cuts cleanly through the dream. \"Your maneuvers… \n\nTe'Qal strains to maintain control over dozens of war-pearls.  The aggressors chase Te'Qal's unpiloted ghost fleet across space, distracted, as other Qugu-piloted combat sleeves sabotage each Murin carrier one by one. \n\n\"…lone-flew the battlegroup. How many others can do so? And when at last you engage them…\"  Te'Dura exudes a wheezing laughter. \"Their fighters won't launch. Their weapons overheat. Their shields lose power. One battle and war-tides turn.\" \n\nTe'Qal coils and flicks their mane-tendrils in consideration. \"I have won great battles. They do not come without sacrifices. I have averted great losses by inflicting my own, but these Hive…\" \n\nThe display shifts to a different theater. \n\nTe'Dura pays Te'Qal's doubts no mind. \n\nTe'Qal drifts through space within a thin, bloodied, combat sleeve. Mechanized tendrils still hot with fusion discharge. \"When the gate fell silent…\" \n\n\"Se'Tar lost concert with Se'Ugn. The Qugu fractured. I felt it bring despair to your spirit, as I said to you then.\"  Te'Dura says. \"Years of existing out of concert drove them to uprising. Your decisiveness ended it, your diplomacy forged peace. It is why you were made Warden.\" \n\nTe'Qal remembers their decisiveness differently. A clandestine detachment of combat sleeves. A raid of burning spears. \"You remind me.\" \n\n\"Not because you forget, but because you have been hopeless before.\" Te'Dura rears into a taller posture. \"There is victory in that darkness. A kind. Find it.\" \n\n***** \n\nThe fleet passes through the gate a few vessels at a time. As each ship slips from Te'Qal's awareness, tiny etchings incised into the gate flare with jade flame.  \n\nTe'Qal slips through the gate and exits into wreckage and confusion. Ark-ships fracture and implode as holy ground bleeds into the vacuum. \n\nAt the other end of the gate they did not find the last Qugu star of Se'Otan, but instead a wall of Hive Tomb Ships surrounding their bone white flagship, flanked by the Qugu's desecrated Mountain, now a black void of malice carved into the fabric of space. \n\n:oldfear: \n\nIn the shadow of the Pyramid, Te'Qal grasps the fleet through the command sleeve, and rallies their captains and battlegroups into defensive murmurations around the remaining ark-ships. Fusion beams cut in every direction, Hive Rippers pierce Qugu warships and combat sleeves like screaming needles. Behind them, the gate is nowhere to be seen. There is no tear, no exit through which to flee. Before them the Hive ships outnumber their fleet hundreds to one. A strange realm—a mirror of reality—encompasses them. \n\nDozens of Hive ships fall and countless Rippers burn for every Qugu vessel lost, but attrition does not favor them. Te'Qal holds the fleet against the horror of the Hive, but their strength wanes. Te'Qal wades through the silence of his ancestors' fear. \n\nSuddenly, a dreaded pillar of darkness—another Hive ship—tears through the nothing of space and bursts into the fray, crashing through several Tomb Ships and dashing them against its hull. Hive ships turn to confront it as it barrels directly for their bone-ring flagship. \n\nThe two massive vessels exchange destructive barrages of fire, decimating all other surrounding ships in thundering bombardments of soulfire cannons and axion bolts. The pillar-ship emits a thin pulse, as the dark Pyramid had done as it burst forth from the Mountain on Seht. The pulse slices through the ring ship like a cleaver; waves of green fire erupting through its hull. \n\nTe'Qal, seizing the moment, capitalizes on the distraction. They draw in all remaining Qugu vessels and press forward toward the Pyramid. \n\nTe'Qal communes their intention to the fleet and maneuvers them into a valiant charge. If they could not destroy the Hive, they would take back the Mountain. Te'Qal places themself at the point of the assault. Qugu ships snap into formation behind them. Te'Qal draws the entirety of the fleet into concert to hear their voice, their words impel the charge into being. \n\n\"For Seht.\" \n\nThe armada surges, agile combat sleeves racing ahead to clear a path for the larger host of ships. Te'Qal feels the presence of the Qugu line, extending back to the first. They move as one, weaving between ship-fire and debris. Te'Qal closes their eyes to feel the fleet through the tension of their link. Te'Qal reaches beyond them, to the death-grove cores of the ark-ships, to their ancestral line. To those whose memories they carry with them. The Darkness that binds them resonates through the fleet. \n\nTe'Qal flexes their tendrils and commands the deployment of all drones in attack mode. The Qugu collapse to form a phalanx and drive forward to impale the cursed thing that was their Mountain. Te'Qal calls to their ancestors, drawing their energy from the ark-ships and into the fleet, fusing the beam with ancient power.  \n\n\"Guide our fire.\" \n\nThe Darkness-linked fury of generations turns the beam Resonant. It strikes true, impaling the Pyramid's obscene hull in a fatal wound. Their final stand forever branded into the Pyramid's flesh. \n\nThe Hive battle falls silent. \n\nA flash of orange. \n\nWith the Pyramid's dying wail, Te'Qal feels the presence of their ancestors, not as a distant guide, but as equals. The Resonance wave washes over them, and Te'Qal hears voices as if echoing from a dream, \"Noble Commander, do not fade. Take our hand and find Salvation.\"  \n\nThey see the line of their people extend through them, through all Qugu, through Darkness, and death, and memory. All swept into an obliterating Echo. And then nothing. \n\nThey extinguish, together.","icon":"/common/destiny2_content/icons/a4d13dcfa396399587f1d94c65b6ad27.png"}},"1855983696":{"hash":1855983696,"index":2783,"redacted":false,"name":null,"iconImagePath":null,"colorImagePath":null,"displayProperties":{"name":"","description":"","icon":"/common/destiny2_content/icons/eaab9dcd13568c4071ea74eb12504930.png"}},"1855983697":{"hash":1855983697,"index":2784,"redacted":false,"name":null,"iconImagePath":null,"colorImagePath":null,"displayProperties":{"name":"","description":"","icon":"/common/destiny2_content/icons/eaab9dcd13568c4071ea74eb12504930.png"}},"1855983699":{"hash":1855983699,"index":2782,"redacted":false,"name":null,"iconImagePath":null,"colorImagePath":null,"displayProperties":{"name":"","description":"","icon":"/common/destiny2_content/icons/eaab9dcd13568c4071ea74eb12504930.png"}},"1855983700":{"hash":1855983700,"index":2787,"redacted":false,"name":null,"iconImagePath":null,"colorImagePath":null,"displayProperties":{"name":"","description":"","icon":"/common/destiny2_content/icons/eaab9dcd13568c4071ea74eb12504930.png"}},"1855983701":{"hash":1855983701,"index":2788,"redacted":false,"name":null,"iconImagePath":null,"colorImagePath":null,"displayProperties":{"name":"","description":"","icon":"/common/destiny2_content/icons/eaab9dcd13568c4071ea74eb12504930.png"}},"1855983702":{"hash":1855983702,"index":2785,"redacted":false,"name":null,"iconImagePath":null,"colorImagePath":null,"displayProperties":{"name":"","description":"","icon":"/common/destiny2_content/icons/eaab9dcd13568c4071ea74eb12504930.png"}},"1855983703":{"hash":1855983703,"index":2786,"redacted":false,"name":null,"iconImagePath":null,"colorImagePath":null,"displayProperties":{"name":"","description":"","icon":"/common/destiny2_content/icons/eaab9dcd13568c4071ea74eb12504930.png"}},"1855983706":{"hash":1855983706,"index":2789,"redacted":false,"name":null,"iconImagePath":null,"colorImagePath":null,"displayProperties":{"name":"","description":"","icon":"/common/destiny2_content/icons/eaab9dcd13568c4071ea74eb12504930.png"}},"1855983707":{"hash":1855983707,"index":2790,"redacted":false,"name":null,"iconImagePath":null,"colorImagePath":null,"displayProperties":{"name":"","description":"","icon":"/common/destiny2_content/icons/eaab9dcd13568c4071ea74eb12504930.png"}},"1883196300":{"hash":1883196300,"index":2760,"redacted":false,"name":null,"iconImagePath":null,"colorImagePath":null,"displayProperties":{"name":"IX. Tech Support","description":"! INCOMING MESSAGE ! \n\nFailsafe's system alert pulled her attention from Nimbus, who was excitedly pacing the H.E.L.M. while delivering a spirited recounting of the last Iron Banner finals. Saladin had been routing the feeds to Neomuna, and the Cloud Strider was thoroughly enraptured by the high drama—judging by Failsafe's internal chronometer, entirely too enraptured. \n\nShe shrewdly routed the message alerts to her external display screen. \"Nimbus, buddy—\" she began. \n\n\"Hint taken,\" Nimbus grinned, spreading their huge hands wide. \"I'll let you get back to your whole being-a-ship thing. If you see Osiris, tell him Jisu Calerondo is looking for an interview about his sick bird hat. Or, no, say that the CloudArk is losing integrity and only the biorhythms from, like, a truly old and decrepit dude will save it!\" \n\n\"I'm on it,\" Failsafe said, and pushed an ASCII image of a thumbs-up to her display. Nimbus laughed and gave Failsafe two enormous finger guns as they transmatted out. \n\nFailsafe accessed her messages. She batch approved the bounty requests from the Guardians still scouring Nessus for the remnants of the Conductor's Vex.  \n\nShe puzzled next over a message from House Light Scribe Eido, as it did not appear to contain any discernable requests. She marked it for non-urgent reply and sorted it into one of her new subfolders: SOCIALIZATION (PLATONIC).  \n\nAnother message was a scheduled reminder to familiarize herself with the H.E.L.M. systems, which were woefully unprepared for the kind of worst-case scenario she had encountered with the Exodus Black. She would have to update the safety systems, bring emergency transmat relays online, calculate possible terrestrial touchdown sites in the unlikely event of a forced landing… unquestionably important work, but, for the first time, she felt it could wait.  \n\nFailsafe eagerly processed the next series of critical system messages. One unintended but entirely welcome consequence of the increased Guardian activity on Nessus was that the resident Fallen were being actively discouraged from raiding her wreckage. Without the constant incursions, her power systems were slowly beginning to build a reserve charge. —! LOW POWER ALERT: 6% !— the warnings blared, and Failsafe beeped with satisfaction.  \n\nThere was a sudden burst of golden flame, a scattering of reflected figures, and Osiris transmatted onto the H.E.L.M. \"Failsafe,\" he said brusquely as he walked toward her console.  \n\n\"Osiris,\" she replied, and opened a swirling readout of polynomial splines. Osiris and Saint had been journeying into the Nessus Vex network and searching for the Conductor, one simulated branch at a time.  \n\nOsiris highlighted portions of 17 intersecting wavelengths. \"Set as cleared,\" he commanded, and Failsafe changed their color to a bright lime green. Osiris zoomed the display out, and the green became a pixel-wide dot amidst the swaying fractal tangle of the network.  \n\n\"Seventeen down,\" Failsafe said, \"infinity to go.\" \n\nOsiris sighed wearily in agreement. \"And the odds that these 17 have already been overwritten are?\" he asked. \n\nFailsafe gave a low-pitched beep. \"Do you need the real math on that? Because it's 99-point-a-whole-lotta-nines.\" \n\nOsiris shook his head. \"She's somewhere in the network, along with the Echo of Command. And even though he knows the chances of finding her are impossibly small, Saint is continuing to search.\" He absently drummed his hands on Failsafe's control panel.  \n\n\"What do you think he'll do if he finds her?\" she asked.  \n\n\"I believe he will… how shall I put this?\" Osiris said softly. The faintest of smiles played over his face. \"Saint doesn't have much patience for anyone who makes those he cares about feel helpless.\"  \n\nOsiris's gaze wandered to the research bays, and Failsafe dispensed a synthesized mealworm into Captain Jacobson's enclosure. The proto-frog blinked slowly, then devoured the grub in one clumsy gulp. Osiris nodded in approval.  \n\n\"Generate a fresh set of network coordinates, please,\" he said, and Failsafe whirred in response as numbers filled her screen. She sent them to Osiris's datapad with a reassuring tone, and he turned to leave. \n\n\"Osiris?\" she said. \"Nimbus… misses hanging out with you. You oughta visit 'em sometime.\"  \n\nOsiris tightened his lips. \"Very well,\" he said, then hesitated. \"Failsafe, be thankful that—\" \n\n! INCOMING MESSAGE ! \n\nThe alert filled Failsafe's display screen, and Osiris stopped himself with a half-shake of his head and a smirk. \"I'll leave you to it,\" he said, and vanished in another flash of golden fire.  \n\nFailsafe sorted through her new messages. —! LOW POWER ALERT: 7% !— read the critical warning, and she dismissed it happily.","icon":"/common/destiny2_content/icons/2cfd18dcf908263d3b1c129e383ea8ce.png"}},"1883196301":{"hash":1883196301,"index":2759,"redacted":false,"name":null,"iconImagePath":null,"colorImagePath":null,"displayProperties":{"name":"VIII. Home to Roost","description":"During the day, the Hall of Heroes is busy with activity. Neomuni in mobile avatars gather in knots, their conversations a low rumble under Quinn Laghari's personally curated ambient soundtrack. \n\nEven after visiting hours, the Hall isn't entirely quiet. Poukas rustle through foliage as water rushes into the pools. And Osiris paces back and forth across the carpet, avoiding Sagira's memorial. \n\nNew footsteps sound in the distance. Osiris turns away from the door and toward a pool. \n\nThe steps are quick, impatient: Nimbus. They slow as they climb the stairs to the Hall. \n\n\"Osiris?\" \n\nThere is a wad of leaves clogging a drain. Osiris contemplates it. He has never asked who cleans out the pouka ponds. \n\n\"It's late. I thought you were done for the day!\" Nimbus's voice is a cheerful buzz echoing against the high ceiling. \n\n\"I was. I am.\" His report has been sent to the Vanguard. It will be some time before Ikora responds. There is no reason for Osiris to pass on this chance for some rest. \n\n\"Still hanging around here, though? Everything good, old bird?\" \n\nNimbus looms over Osiris. Rather than giving himself a crick in the neck looking up, Osiris starts pacing once again. \n\n\"I am thinking about the Conductor. About what we learned.\" \n\nNimbus ambles along, taking one step to every three of Osiris's. \"Want to talk about it?\" \n\n\"Not particularly.\" \n\nThis is something he doesn't want to unfold before anyone other than Sagira, his second mind, his other heart. He wronged her, just as he wronged Saint. \n\n\"Aw, you sure? Everyone says it's easier to carry a burden when someone's there to carry it with you. And I'm pretty strong.\" \n\nNimbus flexes an arm demonstratively. They show every indication of being ready to wait all night for Osiris. Osiris looks up, exasperated, and they give him a huge wink. \n\nThe two of them have spent a great deal of time together, researching first Strand and then Maya Sundaresh's history. Nimbus deserves his honesty. \n\nOsiris crosses his arms and scowls up at the light fixtures. \n\n\"I… After I lost Saint, I pulled another version of him back into the world. I was selfish. I did to Saint what Maya Sundaresh did to Chioma Esi.\" \n\nThere. It's said. \n\n\"Whoa,\" says Nimbus. \"That's, uh, heavy stuff to be dealing with, my man.\" \n\nWaiting for their judgment is agonizing. Saint is home in the Tower, feeding his birds, readying himself to yell into a microphone at fighting Guardians, likely reshelving all of Osiris's books in the wrong place again. And Osiris is far from home, in the wrong, and hoping for understanding. \n\n\"All right, so.\" Nimbus draws their words out, processing. \"The Conductor's been yanking versions of Chioma out of the Net by the handful. And killing them.\" \n\n\"Yes.\"  \n\n\"And when Saint was gone, you went after him into the Infinite Forest. And this could have broken really bad, not just for you, but for like, the whole world.\" \n\n\"Yes.\"  \n\n\"So, this is just me,\" Nimbus says eventually. \"But… Maya found her partner, right? Tons of her. And she like, mulched them. And you went looking for Saint. And you brought him home.\" \n\nNimbus's voice slows as they think through their point. \n\n\"What would you have done if you found Saint and he said, you know, 'Thanks but no thanks? I'm good here'?\" \n\nIn the moment? Osiris knew he would have stood in front of Saint and argued till Osiris starved to death and Sagira had to resurrect him, then done it again. Till he truly understood Saint's reasoning. \n\nOsiris's steps take him to Sagira's memorial. Her cold shell gazes up sightlessly. She'd give him such a lecture if she heard him now. \n\n\"Left him there, I suppose.\" If it was what he truly wanted. Saint-14 was legendarily hard-headed: he knew his own mind. \n\nNimbus comes up to Osiris, looming again. \n\n\"Seems to me you brought Saint back 'cause you missed him. Not because you missed… yourself. What Saint could say about you. Seems pretty different.\" \n\nThey stand together, Nimbus's gaze tracking up to Rohan's memorial. Osiris should call Saint. He should return to the Tower. He's spent quite enough time so far from home. \n\n\"There aren't a lot of chances for a Cloud Strider to find love,\" Nimbus says wistfully. Their eyes, reflected blurrily in the memorial, fill with tears. \"Your story is so romantic. How did you and Saint make it work for so long? How can I find something like that?\" \n\nAnd for all that being asked earnestly for advice based on his relationship is a horror the Vex themselves could never have predicted, Osiris can't reject the plea in those shining eyes.","icon":"/common/destiny2_content/icons/2cfd18dcf908263d3b1c129e383ea8ce.png"}},"2029630105":{"hash":2029630105,"index":2791,"redacted":false,"name":null,"iconImagePath":null,"colorImagePath":null,"displayProperties":{"name":"","description":"","icon":"/common/destiny2_content/icons/eaab9dcd13568c4071ea74eb12504930.png"}},"4240927291":{"hash":4240927291,"index":2796,"redacted":false,"name":null,"iconImagePath":null,"colorImagePath":null,"displayProperties":{"name":"HE DREAMS","description":"It wasn't a dream.
